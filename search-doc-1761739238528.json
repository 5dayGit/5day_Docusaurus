Here are a few tips you might find useful. Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the blog directory. Regular blog authors can be added to authors.yml. The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as: 2019-05-30-welcome.md2019-05-30-welcome/index.md A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images: The blog supports tags as well!

It gathers all the tasks and subtasks assigned to you across projects into a single, organized view. This ensures that you always know what needs your attention, without switching between multiple boards or projects. Accessible to every user, My Work helps you stay focused, prioritize better, and manage your daily workload efficiently. Subscription Association My Work is available across all subscription plans of 5day.io without any restrictions. Who can Access All users can access My Work, irrespective of their role (Admin, Manager, Member, Guest, etc.). No special permissions are required — it’s a default workspace provided individually to each user. How to Access Click on the ‘Home’ icon located in the left sidebar menu of 5day.io. Upon clicking, you will be automatically redirected to the My Work page. The Home icon serves as the fastest way to view your personal task dashboard. My Work Categories Each task within My Work is automatically categorized based on its due date. The number of tasks in each category will be displayed in the header for quick reference. Overdue Tasks and subtasks assigned to you that have missed their due date but are still incomplete. This category highlights urgent actions that require immediate attention to stay on track. Today Tasks and subtasks that are due today or are scheduled for completion today. Use this category to plan your daily activities and meet immediate deadlines. Tomorrow Tasks and subtasks that are scheduled for tomorrow, giving you a clear preview of what's next. This helps you prepare in advance for the coming day and organize your work proactively. Upcoming Tasks and subtasks planned for the next 7 days (after tomorrow) are grouped under Upcoming. This view helps you keep an eye on your medium-term workload and plan ahead effectively. Unscheduled Tasks and subtasks that are assigned to you but have no due date yet. Use this category to identify pending work that needs to be prioritized and scheduled. Features on My Work Along with task visibility, My Work offers powerful utilities to help you manage and organize your workload even better. Search Quickly search through your list of tasks and subtasks by typing keywords. Filter Narrow down your task list by applying specific filters like project name, priority, status, task type, and more. Group By Organize your tasks visually by grouping them by period, status, task type, or priority. Sort Arrange tasks or subtasks in ascending or descending order based on due dates, priorities, status, task type and more. ✅ Pro Tip: Use My Work as your daily starting point to stay organized, prioritize important tasks, and never miss a deadline.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"External Member & Guest","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/user-guide/Onboarding/External Member & Guest","content":"External Member &amp;
