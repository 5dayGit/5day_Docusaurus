# Connect Microsoft Teams Account with 5day.io

The **Connect** command lets you link Microsoft Teams with your 5day.io account, unlocking real-time notifications and the ability to create tasks directly from any Teams chat.

Once connected, the 5day.io bot will appear in your Teams environment, delivering all configured 5day.io alerts (task updates, due dates, comments, etc.) and enabling the **create task** command across 1:1 chats, group chats, and channels.
