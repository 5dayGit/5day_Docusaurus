# Create Task via Microsoft Teams

Turn any Microsoft Teams conversation into an actionable task in 5day.io - **without leaving Teams**.

The **create task** command lets you capture ideas, assign ownership, set due dates, and add context instantly from **channels, group chats, direct messages, or even a single message**.

Once created, the task appears in your 5day.io workspace with a **link back to the original Teams message**, ensuring full traceability.

## Prerequisites

1. Your Teams account must be connected via the 5day.io bot.
2. You must have Create Task permission in the target 5day.io Workspace/Space/Project.
