# Intro to Microsoft Teams Integration

Microsoft Teams integration connects your 5day.io account with Microsoft Teams, allowing you to bridge communication and task management in one ecosystem. 
It enables real-time notifications from 5day.io to flow into Teams channels, chats, and direct messages, while also letting you generate tasks on the fly from team discussions. 
This integration is designed for teams that rely on Microsoft Teams for daily collaboration, ensuring 5day.io becomes a natural extension of your workflow.

## Why is Microsoft Teams Integration Important?
 
Integrating 5day.io with Microsoft Teams eliminates silos between where your team _talks_ and where you _work_. 
In fast-paced environments, discussions often spark ideas or decisions that need immediate action - without integration, these moments get lost in chat threads. 
By syncing notifications and enabling quick task creation, the integration:

-   **Boosts productivity**: Receive 5day.io updates (like task assignments, due dates, or status changes) right in Teams, so nothing slips through the cracks.
-   **Enhances collaboration**: Team members can turn a casual chat message into a trackable task in seconds, assigning owners and deadlines without switching apps.
-   **Reduces context switching**: Keep everyone in the loop across tools, fostering faster decision-making and accountability.
-   **Scales with your team**: Ideal for remote or hybrid setups, where Teams is the hub for communication, ensuring project visibility for all stakeholders.

Whether you're managing sprints, client projects, or daily stand-ups, this integration turns reactive chats into proactive progress.

## Key Features of Teams Integration

As of now, 5day.io's Teams integration focuses on core essentials to streamline notifications and task creation. Here's what's available:

### 5day.io Bot for Notifications

The 5day.io bot acts as your personal project assistant in Teams, delivering all notifications configured in the 5day.io web app directly to your chats. This means you'll get real-time alerts for:

-   Task assignments and updates.
-   Due date reminders.
-   Status changes or comments.
-   Any custom notifications you've set up in 5day.io.

### Create Task Command

Transform any message into a actionable item with the "create task" command, available in 1:1 chats, group chats, and channels. This feature lets you capture ideas instantly without disrupting the flow.

**Supported options**:

-   **From a channel or group chat**: Access prompt **create task**
-   **From a specific message**: Highlight a message, right-click (or use the ellipsis menu), and select "Create Task in 5day.io" to auto-populate the description from the chat.
