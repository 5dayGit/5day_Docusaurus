# Intro to Slack Integration 
Slack integration connects your 5day.io account to Slack workspace, enabling seamless two-way sync between project updates and team communication.
The 5day.io bot delivers all configured 5day.io notifications into Slack, while the /5day.io slash command lets you create tasks instantly from any message.

## Why Integration is Important

Integrating 5day.io with Slack eliminates the gap between **where your team talks** and **where work gets done**.

-   **Capture action items instantly**: Turn a “we should do X” into a task in seconds.
-   **Stay notified in flow**: Get task assignments, due dates, comments, and status changes right in Slack.
-   **Reduce app switching**: No more copying links or retyping context.
-   **Keep everyone aligned**: Stakeholders see updates in channels they already watch.

Perfect for agile teams, remote crews, or anyone using Slack as their collaboration hub.
