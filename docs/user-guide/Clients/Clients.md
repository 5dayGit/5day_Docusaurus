# **Clients**
## **Overview**
In 5day.io, the **Clients** feature allows you to manage and track the companies or organizations you are working with.\
Clients are maintained at the **tenant level**, meaning they are available across all projects within your account.

Adding clients helps you:

- Track how many projects are associated with each client.
- Monitor the number of **Active Projects** (projects still in progress).
- Get a complete view of your **Total Projects** for each client.
