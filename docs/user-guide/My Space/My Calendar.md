# My Calendar
## Overview
My Calendar helps you view all your scheduled tasks in one place.

It shows:

- Tasks assigned to you
- Subtasks assigned to you
- Google Calendar events (if you have synced your Google Calendar)

My Calendar always opens in **Month View** and displays the current month by default.

You can scroll through past and future months, and access the details of any task or event directly from the calendar view.

My Calendar is available from the **Home** section and is designed to give you a clear timeline of your work.
## Who Can Access
All users can access My Calendar.

Users will only see:

- Tasks assigned to them
- Subtasks assigned to them
- Their own connected Google Calendar events (only if Google Calendar integration is enabled and sync is turned on).

Tasks assigned to other team members will not appear in My Calendar.
## How to Access My Calendar
1. Click the **Home** icon from the navigation panel.
1. Select **My Calendar** from the Home menu.

You will now be taken to the monthly calendar view.

## What You Will See in My Calendar
My Calendar displays three types of items:
### **1. Tasks**
Tasks assigned to you with valid dates will appear on the relevant day(s).

Displayed information includes:

- Task icon
- Task title
- Time (always all-day format: 12:00 AM – 11:59 PM)
- Date range (for multi-day tasks)
### **2. Subtasks**
Subtasks work exactly like tasks and follow the same display rules.
### **3. Google Calendar Events**
These events will appear only when:

- You have connected your Google account
- You have enabled sync
- The selected calendar(s) are checked in the sync panel

Each Google event appears with:

- Event icon
- Event title
- Event time (as provided by Google Calendar)
## Navigation in My Calendar
### **Move Between Months**
You can switch between months using:

- `<` to view the previous month
- `>` to view the next month

There is no limit — you can scroll infinitely into past and future months.
### **Jump to Today**
Click **Today** to automatically:

- Jump back to the current month
- Highlight today’s date with a circle
- Position the month so today's date is visible
### **Select a Month Quickly**
Click on the month name (e.g., “November 2025”) to open a selector and jump to any month.
## Calendar Sync Panel
If Google Calendar integration is active, you will see:

**Syncing: X Calendar(s)**

When clicked, a panel opens showing all Google calendars linked to your Google account, such as:

- Primary Calendar
- Holidays

Each calendar has a checkbox.

- **Checked** → Events from that calendar will appear
- **Unchecked** → Events disappear instantly from My Calendar

For more information, refer to the Google Calendar Integration help guide.
## How Tasks and Events Are Displayed
#### 1\. Tasks/Subtasks With a Single Date
If only a **due date** or only a **start date** is present, the task appears on that day.
#### 2\. Multi-Day Tasks
If a task spans multiple days (e.g., 02 Nov → 06 Nov), it will appear as:

- A continuous bar across all days in the date range
- A single unified bar that stretches across the calendar row
#### 3\. All-Day Time Format
Tasks and subtasks always show: **12:00 AM – 11:59 PM**

Google Calendar events display their actual time.
#### 4\. Items Without Dates
If a task or subtask has **no start date and no due date**, it will **not** appear in My Calendar.
### Hover Interactions
When you hover over a task or subtask, you will see:
