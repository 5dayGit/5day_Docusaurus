## **Reminders in 5day.io**
## Overview
**Reminders** in 5day.io help you stay on top of your schedule—whether it's for personal tasks, project deliverables, or team follow-ups. You can create reminders for any important activity and get notified at the right time to take action.

Reminders can be created independently or linked directly to a specific **task or subtask**, offering flexibility to organize your day or plan work-specific updates.
### **Reminder Types**
- **Event Reminders** (e.g., personal or meeting alerts):\
  When creating a new standalone reminder, users are shown a simple **Date** and **Time** picker to set when the reminder should trigger.
- **Task/Subtask Reminders**:\
  When linked to a task or subtask, the **Date** field includes more contextual options:
  - On due date
  - Before due date
  - After due date
  - Custom date (lets the user manually choose any date)

This makes it easy to schedule task-related nudges based on deadlines or key project dates.
