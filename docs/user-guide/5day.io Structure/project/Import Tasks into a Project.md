4.  **Download the Sample File**: Once the import dialog appears, click
    on **Download Sample File**. This will download an Excel file with
    two sheets:

    a.  **Template Sheet**: This is where you need to input all the task
        details.

    b.  **Guideline Sheet**: This sheet provides guidelines for entering
        data correctly for each field.

5.  **Enter Data in the Template**: Open the Excel file, and fill in the
    task details in the **Template** sheet. Refer to the **Guideline**
    sheet if you need help understanding the data format or field
    requirements.

6.  **Save the File**: After entering the necessary details, save the
    file.

7.  **Upload the File**: Return to the import dialog and click on
    **Upload from Computer**. Select the saved file and click on
    **Import** to import the task data into 5day.io.

#### **Method 2: Importing from Project Settings**

    dialog and click on **Upload from Computer**. Select your file and
    click on **Import** to upload the tasks into the project.

Once the tasks are imported, you can view the import details in the
**Data Import History** section. Here, you will see:

-   **Date and Time** of import

-   **File Imported**

-   **Imported By** (the user who initiated the import)

-   **Type** (type of import)

-   **Status** (success or failure)

-   **Total Records** (number of records in the file)

-   **Records Imported** (successful imports)

-   **Records Failed** (failed imports)

If there are any issues with the import, the system will display:

-   The **records** that failed to import

You can also download an **Excel file** listing the records that failed.
This allows you to identify and correct any issues with the data.
