## **Workspace-Level Enablement**
Sprint Management is **enabled by default** at the workspace level if your subscription plan (e.g., Growth Plan) supports it.

**Key Points:**

- Sprint Management allows you to manage sprints across your projects, and (if enabled) use story points for estimation.
- For each workspace where Sprint Management is enabled, you can configure:
  - **Default Sprint Duration**: Set how long each sprint should last (e.g., 14 days, 2 weeks).
  - **Story Points**: Enable or disable the use of story points for tracking task complexity or effort.

This gives your team flexibility to define how sprints should work **workspace by workspace**.

## **Enable or Disable Sprint Management at the Workspace Level**
If you don’t want Sprint Management enabled for a specific workspace:

1. **Go to Workspace Settings**: Navigate to the workspace where you want to disable Sprint Management.
1. **Open Customization**: Inside workspace settings, click on the **Customization** tab.
1. **Locate Sprint Management**: Find the Sprint Management option in the customization panel.
1. **Toggle Off**: Use the toggle button to disable Sprint Management for this workspace.

✅ **Note:**

- You can **re-enable Sprint Management** anytime using the same toggle.
