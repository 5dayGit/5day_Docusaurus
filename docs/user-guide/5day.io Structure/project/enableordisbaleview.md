## **How to Enable or Disable Views for a Project**
To enable or disable specific views in a project in 5day.io, follow these steps:

**1. Go to Project Settings**\
Navigate to the project where you want to manage views. Click on the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name and select **Project Settings**.

**2. Access the Views Tab**\
Inside Project Settings, click on **Views**. You will see a list of available views for the project.

**3. Enable or Disable Views**\
Each view has a **toggle button**. You can enable or disable any of the following:

- **List View**: The default way to display tasks in a clear, table-style list.
- **Board View**: A visual Kanban-style board where tasks appear as cards that can be dragged between columns based on status or other groupings.
- **Timesheet**: Allows you to track and log time spent on tasks, with options to view by day, week, or month.
- **Dashboard**: Displays project performance using widgets and charts, giving you a quick overview of key metrics.
- **Files**: A dedicated space to upload, store, and manage files related to the project.
- **Discussion**: Enables a chat-like space where team members can post updates, tag colleagues (@mention), and hold project-specific discussions.
- **Activity Stream**: Provides a detailed log of all activity related to the project—such as who changed what, when a feature was enabled/disabled, or when settings were updated.

**Note:** All changes are saved automatically when you toggle a view on or off.
