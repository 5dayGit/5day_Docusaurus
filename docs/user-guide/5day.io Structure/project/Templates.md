## Overview 
**Templates** in 5day.io help you save time and maintain consistency by reusing the structure of frequently repeated projects. Instead of recreating the same setup each time, you can save a project as a template and use it to quickly launch new projects with predefined configurations. 

Templates are ideal for: 
* Standardized workflows (e.g., onboarding, implementation, hiring) 
* Repeatable task structures across clients or teams 

⠀Each project template can store: 
* Template Name
* Template Image
* Template Description
* Optionally copy: 
* Project Details  
* Sections 
* Tasks Details  
* Subtasks Details
