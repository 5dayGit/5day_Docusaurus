## **Sprint Management**

**Sprint Management** in 5day.io is designed to help teams working in sprints (like Agile or Scrum workflows) manage their work in time-boxed iterations. It brings structure to task planning, tracking, and reporting by organizing your project into sprints with clear start/end dates, progress tracking, and detailed reporting.
### **What Does Sprint Management Enable?**
- **Sprint-Based Workflows:**\
  Break down your project into sprints (typically 1–4 weeks) and manage tasks within each sprint cycle.
- **Story Points & Estimations:**\
  Optionally enable **story points** to estimate task complexity alongside time-based estimations. Both can be used together for better sprint planning.
- **Sprint Settings:**\
  Configure:
  - Sprint duration (how long each sprint will last)
  - Sprint start date
  - Sprint creation (e.g., how many sprints you want pre-created)
- **Sprint Analytics & Reporting:**\
  Gain insight through sprint-specific charts and dashboards:
  - **Sprint Burndown Chart**
  - **Sprint Burnup Chart**
  - **Sprint Velocity Chart**

These visual reports help you monitor sprint progress, forecast completion, and improve team performance over time.
