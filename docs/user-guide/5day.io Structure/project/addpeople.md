# Add People to a Project 
You can easily add existing members of your 5day.io workspace to a project using one of two methods. This ensures the right people have access and visibility to collaborate on the project tasks. 
### Option 1: Add via Project Menu 
1 Go to the project where you want to add members. 
2 Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name. 
3 Select **Add People** from the dropdown. 
4 From the list of existing workspace members, select the users you want to add. 
5 Click **Add** — they’ll immediately be added to the project. 

⠀Option 2: Add via Project Settings 
1 Inside the project, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name. 
2 Select **Project Settings**. 
3 In the Project Settings menu, go to the **People** tab. 
4 Click on **Add People**. 
5 Choose members from the existing list and click **Add**. 

✅ Note: Only existing workspace members can be added to a project. If someone isn't part of your workspace yet, you’ll need to invite them to the workspace first before assigning them to a project.
 
### Invite New Members to a Project 
You can invite people who are **not yet part of your workspace** directly to a project. They’ll receive an email invitation and be added with the selected role once they join. 
You can invite them using either of the two options below: 
 
#### Option 1: Invite via Project Menu 
1 Navigate to the project. 
2 Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name. 
3 Select **Invite People**. 
4 Choose **Invite by Email**. 
5 Enter the person’s **email address** and **select their role** (e.g., Member, Manager, Guest). 
6 Click **Invite**. 

✅ An invitation email will be sent. Once the user accepts the invite, they’ll be able to log in and access the project. 
 
#### Option 2: Invite via Project Settings 
1 Go to the project and click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name. 
2 Select **Project Settings**. 
3 Navigate to the **People** tab. 
4 Click on **Invite New**. 
5 Choose **Invite by Email**. 
6 Enter the **email address**, assign the **role**, and click **Invite**. 

✅ The invited person will receive an email with instructions to join. After confirming their email, they’ll be added directly to the project.
