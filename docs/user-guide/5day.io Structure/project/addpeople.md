## Add People to a Project
You can easily add existing members of your 5day.io workspace to a project using one of two methods. This ensures the right people have access and visibility to collaborate on the project tasks.
### **Option 1: Add via Project Menu**
1. Go to the project where you want to add members.
1. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name.
1. Select **Add People** from the dropdown.
1. From the list of existing workspace members, select the users you want to add.
1. Click **Add** — they’ll immediately be added to the project.
### **Option 2: Add via Project Settings**
1. Inside the project, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name.
1. Select **Project Settings**.
1. In the Project Settings menu, go to the **People** tab.
1. Click on **Add People**.
1. Choose members from the existing list and click **Add**.

✅ *Note: Only existing workspace members can be added to a project. If someone isn't part of your workspace yet, you’ll need to invite them to the workspace first before assigning them to a project.*

## **Invite New Members to a Project**
You can invite people who are **not yet part of your workspace** directly to a project. They’ll receive an email invitation and be added with the selected role once they join.

You can invite them using either of the two options below:

### **Option 1: Invite via Project Menu**
1. Navigate to the project.
1. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name.
1. Select **Invite People**.
1. Choose **Invite by Email**.
1. Enter the person’s **email address** and **select their role** (e.g., Member, Manager, Guest).
1. Click **Invite**.

An invitation email will be sent. Once the user accepts the invite, they’ll be able to log in and access the project.

### **Option 2: Invite via Project Settings**
1. Go to the project and click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name.
1. Select **Project Settings**.
1. Navigate to the **People** tab.
1. Click on **Invite New**.
1. Choose **Invite by Email**.
1. Enter the **email address**, assign the **role**, and click **Invite**.

✅ *The invited person will receive an email with instructions to join. After confirming their email, they’ll be added directly to the project.*
