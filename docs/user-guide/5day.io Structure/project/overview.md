# Projects 

## Overview 
Projects in 5day.io are how you organize and manage a group of tasks that are part of a larger goal, initiative, or deliverable. Every task you create belongs to a project, making it easier to group related work, assign responsibilities, and track progress in one central place. 
Use projects to: 
* Group related tasks under one initiative. 
* Set timelines with project start and end dates. 
* Track progress using different views such as List or Board. 
* Collaborate with your team using files, and discussions. 
* Get visibility into all task-level details without losing sight of the big picture. 

⠀Each project supports additional metadata like project description, client assignment (if enabled), tags, custom fields, and more—so your team has all the context in one place. 
✅ Projects form the foundation for execution in 5day.io. Whether you're launching a new product, running a client engagement, or managing an internal sprint, it all starts with creating a project.

## Project Attributes 
Each project in 5day.io includes a set of configurable attributes that help you define the scope and track the status:

* **Budget Type** – Select whether the project is billable or non-billable 
* **Prefix** – A short code added to all tasks ID within the project (e.g., MKTG-101) 
* **Progress** – Track % completion of the project 
* **Owner** – Assign responsibility to a specific person
