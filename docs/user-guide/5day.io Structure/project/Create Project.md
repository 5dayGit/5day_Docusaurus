# Create Project
You can create a project in two ways in 5day.io:

#### **1. Create From Scratch**
Use this option to manually create a new project from any of the following locations:

**Where can you add a project from?**

- **Workspace Menu**: Click on the workspace name in the left sidebar. Then click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to it and choose **Add Project** to add it under that workspace.
- **Space Menu**: Inside a workspace, click on the space name, open the **three-dot menu**, and choose **Add Project** to add it under that space.
- **Project Menu**: Next to an existing project, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** and select **Add Project**. This will place the new project in the same space as the existing one.

  Click it, and from the dropdown menu, select **Project** to start project creation.
