1. **Configure Views**
   1. You’ll see a list of available views like:
      - **List View**: The default way to display tasks in a clear, table-style list.
      - **Board View**: A visual Kanban-style board where tasks appear as cards that can be dragged between columns based on status or other groupings.
      - **Timesheet**: Allows you to track and log time spent on tasks, with options to view by day, week, or month.
      - **Dashboard**: Displays project performance using widgets and charts, giving you a quick overview of key metrics.
      - **Files**: A dedicated space to upload, store, and manage files related to the project.
      - **Discussion**: Enables a chat-like space where team members can post updates, tag colleagues (@mention), and hold project-specific discussions.
      - **Activity Stream**: Provides a detailed log of all activity related to the project—such as who changed what, when a feature was enabled/disabled, or when settings were updated.
   1. **List View** is always enabled and cannot be disabled.
   1. Use the toggle switches next to each view to turn them on or off based on your preference.
   1. You can also **reorder views** to set the preferred navigation order by dragging them up or down.
1. **Changes are Saved Automatically**\
   Once you make your selections, the settings are applied instantly—no need to click Save.
