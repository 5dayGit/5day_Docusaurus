# Task Assignee

The **Assignee** field in 5day.io helps identify the person responsible for completing a task or subtask.

Assigning tasks ensures clarity of responsibility, improves collaboration, and provides better visibility across the team.

When a task or subtask is assigned, the user is notified and can easily track it under **My Work** or the respective project views.

In 5day.io, a task can be assigned to a single person or to multiple people if the project setting **Multiple Assignee** is enabled.

Subtasks, however, can be assigned to **only one person**. Before assigning, the user must be part of the project.

## Subscription Association

## Permission Set

Assignment of tasks and subtasks is controlled through the **Edit Task** permission set

 Refer to [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) for more details.

## Access and Manage Assignees

### Task and Subtask Assignment

Open the task or subtask you want to assign.

In 5day.io, tasks can be assigned to multiple people if the **Multiple Assignee** feature is enabled at **Project Settings → Feature → Multiple Assignee**.

If the feature is not enabled, a task can be assigned to a single person only.

Subtasks can always be assigned to a **single person only**.

A user must be part of the project team before being assigned.
