# List of Subtasks
List of Subtasks displays every Subtask linked to a parent Task in a clear, expandable view - so you can track progress, assign owner, and manage small steps without leaving the main Task.

## Permission  
You should have ** View Permission** to view all the subtasks associated to a task.

## Access List of Subtasks 

### Task Details

-   Open any Task -> **Task Details** panel (right side)
-   Click the **Subtasks** tab
-   **All subtasks** appear in a full list -> **regardless of status** (New, In Progress, Done)
-   Best for deep management: add, reorder, bulk edit, or open full subtask details.

-   If **"Show subtasks as separate tasks"** is enabled in Project/section views settings (three dots beside group by) -> All subtasks appear as **independent rows/cards** in **List View** and **Board View** -> No need to expand — they live alongside regular Tasks -> Still linked to parent 
-   **Enable it**: List/Board View Settings -> More Icon (three dots beside group by) -> toggle **Show subtasks as separate tasks**
