# Bulk Update

Bulk Update lets you select up to 50 Tasks (or Subtasks) at once and change one field across all of them in a single click - saving hours on repetitive edits like updating status, assignee, or priority for an entire project.

## Permission 
 
You should have **Edit Permission** in Task under **Roles and Permission.**
Below are further details on Edit permission.

|Permission Level  | Description |
|--|--|
|All |Applies to **all tasks** in the project, regardless of ownership. |
|Own  |Applies only to tasks where user is **Owner**. |
|Related  |Applies to tasks in which user is added as **Project Owner** or **Project member**  |
|None  |The user does **not have any access** for the selected action  |

## Way Bulk Update

### Select Tasks

-   In **List View** or **Board View**: -> Click the checkbox next to each Task -> Max 50: system warns if you try more.
-   **For Subtasks**: Switch to **"Show subtasks as separate tasks"** mode first (Project Views -> Customization)

### Bulk Action Bar Appears

-   Once tasks are selected -> a **black bar slides up from the bottom**
-   Shows: “X Tasks selected” + buttons for quick actions

### Update a Single Field

-   Click **Edit** in the action bar → pick **one field** to change (e.g., Status, Assignee, Priority, Tags, Due Date, etc..)
-   Set the new value → **Apply to All**
-   **Instant**: All selected Tasks update simultaneously - no refresh needed
