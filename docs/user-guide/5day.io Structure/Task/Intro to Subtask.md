# Intro to Subtask
In 5day.io, a **Subtask** is a smaller actionable item that breaks down a main task into manageable steps.

It helps organize and track progress at a finer level. Subtasks inherit most of their characteristics from the parent task and maintain close association with it.

Subtasks can be assigned individually, prioritized, and tracked separately. However, subtasks cannot have their own subtasks - they are always one level below the main task. This enables clear hierarchy and simple task organization without overcomplication.

## **Why is a Subtask Important?**

Subtasks are the **secret sauce** that turns big, intimidating Tasks into bite-sized wins - making progress feel real and momentum unstoppable. Here’s why they’re a game-changer in 5day.io:

-   **Breaks Down Complexity**: A Task like “Launch Website” sounds scary - Subtasks turn it into “Design homepage → Write copy → Test on mobile,” so nothing feels overwhelming.
-   **Boosts Clarity & Ownership**: Each Subtask can be assigned to a specific person with a clear deadline, so everyone knows _exactly_ what they’re responsible for - no more “I thought you were doing that.”
-   **Enables Parallel Work**: Subtasks let teams move fast in sync, without stepping on toes.
-   **Improves Accuracy in Tracking**: See real-time progress roll up to the parent Task.

## Key Features of Subtask

5day.io Subtasks are lightweight but **mighty**, packed with smart features to keep execution smooth and satisfying:

-   **Nested Hierarchy**: Live directly under a parent Task - drag, drop, indent, or outdent with one click to restructure on the fly.
-   **Independent Assignment & Due Dates**: Assign a Subtask to a different person than the parent Task, set unique deadlines, and get personal reminders - perfect for cross-functional handoffs.
-   **Status & Progress Sync**: Mark Subtasks as To Do, In Progress, or Done - watch completion percentages.
-   **Comments & Attachments**: Discuss, @mention, or attach files _per Subtask_ - keep context close to the action, no digging through endless threads.
-   **Time Tracking**: Log time spent on individual Subtasks for accurate effort reporting - great for client billing or personal productivity insights.
-   **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple Subtasks to update status, reassign, or delete in one go - save clicks, crush repetition.
-   **Roll-Up Reporting**: Subtask data feeds directly into Task analytics - see who’s overloaded, what’s delayed, and what’s crushing it - all in one dashboard.

Subtasks aren’t just smaller Tasks - they’re **precision tools** for focus, flow, and flawless delivery. Use them well, and you’ll wonder how you ever managed without them.
