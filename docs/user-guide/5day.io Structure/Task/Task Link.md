# Task Link
**Links** allow users to establish a direct relationship between two or more tasks or subtasks within the same project. Linking helps visualize dependencies, track related work, and manage task relationships efficiently.

This is especially useful in complex projects where multiple tasks are interconnected or dependent on each other. A linked task offers a clear view of associated work and encourages collaboration across teams.

When a task is linked to another, the connection is **visible in both directions** - meaning, if Task A is linked to Task B, both tasks will show this association in their respective details.

## Subscription Association
Task Linking is available under the **Growth Plan**.

## Roles and Permission

The ability to link tasks depends on the **Task Edit** permission assigned to your role. 
Only users with the appropriate edit access can add or remove task links.
Refer [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) for more details.

## Add Link

You can add links to tasks through several interfaces in 5day.io. Here's how:

### From Task/Subtask Details

 1. Open the task or subtask detail page.
 2. Locate the **"Link"** field under task details.
 3. Click **"Add Link"** – the system will display a list of tasks and subtasks from the same project.
 4. Select one or more tasks to link.
 5. The selected tasks will now be linked and reflected in both task views.

### From List View / Board View / Task Details More Menu
| View | Access Method |
|--|--|
| **List View** | Click on the **More (****⋮)** icon at the end of the task row |
| **Board View** | Click on the **More (****⋮)** icon at the top of the task card |
| **Task Details View** | Click on the **More (****⋮)** icon at the top-right of the task detail panel |

Once you click **Add Link**, the system will show all linkable tasks and subtasks within the same project. You can select one or multiple to create the link.

### My Work

1. Navigate to **My Work** from the main menu.
2. Click on the relevant task to open its detail page.
3. Use the **Link** field as described above to add links to other tasks or subtasks.

### Bulk Update

1. Select multiple tasks or subtasks from the list or board view.
2. The **Bulk Update** bar will appear.
3. Choose the **Link** field within bulk update.
4. Select one or more tasks/subtasks to link.
5. The selected links will apply to all selected tasks.

### Quick Add (While Creating Task)

1. While using the **Quick Add** option to create a task, enter the task name and select its location.
2. Select the **Link** field during creation.
3. Choose from the list of available tasks or subtasks in the same project.
4. Upon selection, tasks will be linked immediately after creation.

### Mutual Visibility of Links

Once a link is created between two tasks, it becomes **mutually visible**—both the source task and the linked task will reflect this association in their details.

This ensures transparency and better navigation across related work items.

## Remove Link

To remove an existing link from a task, use any of the following views:
| Method | Steps |
|--|--|
| **Task/Subtask Details** | Open the task -> Locate the **Link** section -> Click the **Remove** icon beside the linked task |
| **List View / Board View** | Open the More Menu (⋮) -> Select **Edit** or open Task Details -> Remove links via the Link section |
| **My Work** | Open task from My Work → Use the same Link section to remove any unwanted linked tasks |
