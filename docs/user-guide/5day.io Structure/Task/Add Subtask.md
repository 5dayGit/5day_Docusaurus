# Add Subtask
In 5day.io, Add Subtask lets you break any Task into smaller, actionable steps. 
Open a Task, click + Add Subtask, enter a concise title, and set assignee, due date, or notes as needed. 
Your Subtask instantly nests under the parent task.

## Subscription Association
**Subtask** is available in all subscription plans.

**Subscription Plan**

| Plan | Number of Task|
|--|--|
| Free | 1000 |
| Growth | Unlimited |

## Who can create Task

Users must have **Add Task** permission to add new task or subtask.

If not allowed, the system will restrict task creation actions. Refer [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Workspace/Roles%20and%20Permission%20for%20Workspace.md) for more details.

## Ways to Add Subtask

Before creating or managing subtasks, ensure the **Subtask feature** is enabled at the **Project**.

-   Navigate to: **Project Settings → Features → Subtask**.
-   Toggle **ON** to activate the subtask functionality.

Once the feature is enabled, subtasks can be created in the following ways:

### From List View / Board View

 If a task **does not** have subtasks so far:

 1. Hover over the task to reveal the **Add Subtask** icon.
 2. Click the icon, enter the **title** of the subtask, and it will be created.

If a task **already have** subtasks:

 1. A **subtask icon with a count** will appear beside the task.
 2. Click the icon to view the existing list of subtasks.
 3. Click **‘Add Subtask’** at the bottom of the list to create a new one.

Subtask creation follows the same flow as creating a main task (Title mandatory; optional fields can be filled as needed).

### From Task Details Panel

Two ways are available inside the Task Details panel:

Through **More Menu**

1.  Click on the **More** icon from the Task Details panel/List View Task Row/Board View Task Card.
2.  Select **Add Subtask** from the dropdown menu.
3.  You will be redirected to the Subtask list view.
4.  Enter the **title** for the subtask and it will be created.

Through **Subtask Tab**

1.  Open the **Task Details** panel.
2.  Navigate to the **Subtasks** tab.
3.  Click **‘Add Subtask’** at the bottom.
4.  Enter the **title** and create the subtask seamlessly.

Both options offer an easy and fast way to manage your subtasks within the parent task structure.

## Subtask Fields

All fields available in a subtask are identical to a main task. For detailed field descriptions, refer Task Details.

⚡ **Tip:** In 5day.io, **you cannot create a subtask under another subtask.** Subtasks are always one level beneath a main task to keep project hierarchies clean, manageable, and organized.
