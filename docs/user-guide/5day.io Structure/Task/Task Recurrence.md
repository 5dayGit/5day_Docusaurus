# Task Recurrence
Task Recurrence turns any Task into a self-repeating machine - automatically creating new copies on your exact schedule (daily standups, weekly reports, monthly invoices, yearly audits) without lifting a finger after setup.

## Permission 
 
You need **Edit task permission** in the source task and **Add task permission** to create recurred tasks.

## Ways to Access Duplicate Task

### List View / Board View

-   Select a Task → click **three dots** → **Set Recurrence**

### Task Details

-   Open Task -> **Task Details** panel (right side) -> click **three dots** (top-right) -> **Set Recurrence**

### My Work

 -   Go to **My Work** -> find your Task -> click **three dots** -> **Set Recurrence**

## Duplicate Task – Configuration Panel
When you open Set Recurrence, a powerful yet simple panel appears:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| Frequency | Pick how often the Task repeats — the heartbeat of your recurrence. Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly:
| Daily -> Repeat Every | On selected days (☑ Mon–Sun) or Every X days (1, 2, 3…) Choose specific weekdays or a fixed gap in days. |
| Weekly -> On | Select one or more days of the week to trigger. |
| Weekly -> Repeat Every | Set the interval between weekly cycles (e.g., every 2 weeks). |
| Monthly -> On | Anchor to a date or relative weekday in the month. |
| Monthly -> Repeat Every | Define how many months to skip between repeats. |
| Yearly -> On | Pin to a calendar date or floating weekday. |
| Yearly -> Repeat Every | Set the gap between yearly instances. |
| Start Date | Calendar picker. First recurrence runs on or after this date — your launch point. |
| Ends On | Never / On specific date / After X occurrences. Stop forever, on a fixed date, or after a set count. |
| Skip Holidays and Weekoffs | Auto-shift to next valid workday — no Tasks on closed days. |

### Show Recurred Tasks via Icon

Every recurred Task displays a **🔄 recurrence icon** in List, Board, and Task Details views.
