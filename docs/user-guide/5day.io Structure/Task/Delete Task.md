# Delete Task
Deleting a task in 5day.io allows users to permanently remove unwanted or incorrect records from their project.

Deletion ensures that the task is no longer accessible or recoverable once removed. This action is irreversible, so it should be performed cautiously.

Both tasks and subtasks have similar deletion processes and are governed by permission settings..

## Who Can Delete Task

Deleting tasks depends on the **permission set** assigned to the user:

-   **Delete All:** User can delete any task/subtask across the project.
-   **Delete Owned:** User can delete only tasks/subtasks where they are assigned.
-   **Delete Related:** User can delete tasks/subtasks where they are a project owner or member.
-   **Delete None:** User is restricted from deleting any tasks or subtasks.
