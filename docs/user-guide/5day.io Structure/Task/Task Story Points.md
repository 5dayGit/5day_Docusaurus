# Story Points

Story Points in 5day.io represent a unit of measure used to express the overall effort required to complete a task or subtask.

Unlike time-based estimation, story points are abstract and typically based on complexity, risk, and uncertainty.

They help teams evaluate work comparatively and prioritize tasks more effectively. 

This method is especially beneficial for agile project management.

Story Points are numeric values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…) and are used to maintain consistent relative sizing across tasks. Each task and subtask maintains its own individual story point value.

## Subscription Association

## Permission Set

Assignment of Story Points is governed by the **Edit Task** permission set:

-   **Edit All** – User can assign story points to any task/subtask.
-   **Edit Owned** – User can assign story points only to tasks/subtasks they own.
-   **Edit Related** – User can assign story points to tasks/subtasks linked to their projects.
-   **Edit None** – User cannot assign or edit story points.

Refer [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) for more details.

## Access and Manage Story Points

To use story points, the **Story Points** feature must be enabled from **Project Settings → Features → Story Points**.

Once enabled, the **Story Points** field will be available for all tasks and subtasks.

The field accepts numeric values, and there is no predefined limit on value range.

Story Points are independent between tasks and subtasks, and changes in one do not affect the other.
