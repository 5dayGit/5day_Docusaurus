# Task Budget Type

The **Budget Type** allows to classify each task and subtask as either **Billable** or **Non-billable**. This classification plays a key role in tracking and managing project costs, billing cycles, and productivity.

Budget Type helps ensure that the time logged against tasks is categorized appropriately, offering better financial insights and reporting accuracy. It provides clarity on which efforts are chargeable to clients and which are internal or overhead efforts.

## Subscription Association
This feature is available in **all subscription plans**.

## Roles and Permission

The **Budget Type** can be edited only by users who have appropriate **Task Edit Permissions**, based on their roles.

Refer [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) for more details.

To access the Budget Type field, the feature must be enabled at the project - **Project Settings -> Features -> Enable 'Budget Type'**

Once enabled, each task and subtask will display a Budget Type field.

Available values are:

-   **Billable**
