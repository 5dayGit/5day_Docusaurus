# Task Estimation

Estimation in 5day.io helps in defining the expected effort required to complete a task or subtask.

It is a numeric value based on selected time units and serves as a planning tool for better workload management, tracking, and forecasting.

Estimation values are individual for tasks and subtasks and are not interlinked.

You can configure different duration formats based on your preference. This allows teams to plan and distribute their work more efficiently and transparently across the project.

## Subscription Association

## Permission Set

Assignment of estimation values is controlled through the **Edit Task** permission set:

-   **Edit All** – User can set estimation for any task or subtask.
-   **Edit Owned** – User can set estimation for tasks/subtasks they own.
-   **Edit Related** – User can set estimation for tasks/subtasks related to their projects.
-   **Edit None** – User cannot set or modify estimations.

_Refer to the_ _Permission Set Guide_ _for more details._

## Access and Manage Estimation

To enable the Estimation field for tasks and subtasks, the **Time Estimates** feature must be turned on at **Project Settings → Features → Time Estimates**.

Once enabled, the estimation field becomes available for all tasks and subtasks.

Estimation can be added and viewed in different formats, which can be configured from **My Profile → Display Settings → Duration Format**.

Supported Duration Formats:

-   **Clock (hh:mm)** – Display estimation as hours and minutes format, e.g., 02:30.
-   **Days (dd.dd)** – Display estimation in decimal format of days, e.g., 1.50 days.
-   **Days, Hours, Minutes** – Break estimation into days, hours, and minutes separately.
-   **Hours (hh.hh)** – Display estimation in decimal format of hours, e.g., 5.75 hours.
-   **Hours, Minutes** – Display estimation specifically in hours and minutes fields.

The selected format applies across all views where estimation is used.

### Assignee Wise Estimation

5day.io also provides flexibility where, if a task is assigned to multiple people, estimation can vary individually for each assignee.

To enable this, turn on the **Assignee Wise Estimation** feature from **Project Settings → Features → Assignee Wise Estimation**.

Once enabled, the system will ask for handling already created tasks:

-   **Split the estimation equally** – Divides existing estimations equally among all assignees.
-   **Disable equal division** – Keeps current estimations unchanged; users can manually configure later.

Going forward:

You can configure a different estimation value for each user assigned to a task.

If needed, you can choose not to apply assignee-wise estimation at the individual task level by disabling the **Estimates by Person** option during editing.

This provides complete flexibility to manage estimations either collectively or individually based on project needs.
