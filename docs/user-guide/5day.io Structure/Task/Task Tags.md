# Tags
Tags are custom keywords or labels that you can add to tasks and subtasks in 5day.io to organize, group, and filter work items efficiently.

Tags are flexible and allow users to classify tasks based on priority, departments, topics, workflows, or any custom criteria. They help in improving searchability, visibility, and context management across projects.

There is no limitation to the number of tags you can create or assign. Tags are free-text based and can be edited or updated anytime.

To use tags, the **Tags** feature must be enabled at the project level.

## Subscription Association

## Permission Set

Assignment of tags to tasks and subtasks is controlled through the **Edit Task** permission set:

-   **Edit All** – User can assign tags to any task or subtask.
-   **Edit Owned** – User can assign tags to tasks/subtasks they own.
-   **Edit Related** – User can assign tags to tasks/subtasks related to their projects.
-   **Edit None** – User cannot assign or edit tags.

Refer to [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) for more details.
