# Priority

The **Priority** field helps teams rank tasks and subtasks based on their urgency or business impact. This ensures that high-priority tasks are addressed first and resource allocation is optimized.

Each task and subtask can carry a priority label that reflects its relative importance within a project. Priority settings enhance visibility, planning, and focus across teams.

These values are configurable at the workspace and project, giving you control over what priority levels are available and how they’re applied.

## Subscription Association

This feature is available in **all subscription plans** of 5day.io.

## Permission Set

The ability to assign or edit **Priority** values depends on the **Task Edit Permissions** of the user’s role.

## How Priority Works

1.  **Priorities are configured at the Workspace settings** and inherited by projects.

-   Go to: **Workspace Settings → Customization → Priority**.
-   Here, a list of **pre-configured priorities** is available to every workspace.
-   These priorities will automatically apply to new projects created in the workspace.
-   Users can **rename**, **enable/disable**, or **set a default** priority.

2.  To enable Priority within a specific project:

-   Go to: **Project Settings → Features → Enable 'Priority'**
-   Once enabled, go to: **Project Settings → Customization → Priority**.
	- The list of priorities from the workspace will appear.
-   Users can:
	- Change names of the priorities.
	- Enable/disable individual priorities (only **enabled priorities** will be selectable in tasks/subtasks).
	- Set a **default priority**, which will auto-assign to all newly created tasks/subtasks.
