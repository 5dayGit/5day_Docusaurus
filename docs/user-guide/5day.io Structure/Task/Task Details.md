# Task Details
Once the user accesses a task in 5day.io, a detailed panel opens on the right side of the screen. This panel contains complete information about the task/subtask and allows users to view and edit details depending on their permission level.

Please [Roles and Permission](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Task/Roles%20and%20Permission%20of%20Task.md) to Edit Task & Subtask

The Task Details Panel is divided into three major sections:

## Task Header
The Task Header provides instant context with task location, overdue alerts, editable title, expand/collapse controls, a More actions menu and a close button to exit the panel.

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| Task Location | Displays the project and section where the task is located. Helps users know where the task belongs. |
| Overdue | If the due date has passed and the task is not completed, an overdue icon will be shown. |
| Title | Displays the title of the task/subtask. The title can be edited if permission allows. |
| Expand/Collapse | Allows the task panel to be expanded to full screen or collapsed for easier navigation. |
| More | Provides access to additional actions like Duplicate Task, Move Task, Delete Task, etc. |
| Close | Closes the Task Details Panel and returns to the previous view. |
