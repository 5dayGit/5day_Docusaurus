# Space Views

The Space Views provide a centralized interface to access and manage all Projects within a specific Space, organized under their parent Workspace.

Available to all accounts regardless of subscription plan.

Space Views offer two display options - List View and Board View - to suit different workflow preferences. This guide explains how to access and use these views to navigate, organize, and customize your Space data.

## Access Space View

To access the Space Views, follow these steps:

1. **After Login -> Navigate to Projects:** Click the Project icon in the primary panel.
2. **Structure View:** Displays a list of all Workspaces in the secondary panel, with the hierarchy data (Spaces, Projects, Sections, Tasks, Subtasks) of the first Workspace loaded in the Right Panel.
3. **Structure View -> Select a Space:** You will be redirected to a list of all Projects of the first Space within the selected Workspace, organized by their hierarchy (Space > Project).
4. **Load Space Views:** Upon selecting a Space in Structure View, the Right Panel will load the Space View, with List View as the default.

## Space Views

Space Views offer two display modes: List View and Board View. 
Both views provide identical functionality, differing only in their visual presentation.

### List View
List View displays Projects in a structured, hierarchical list within the selected Space. Each Project is accessible with a single click, providing a clear and compact overview.

### Board View

Board View presents Projects as visual cards on a Kanban-style board within the selected Space. Each card represents a Project and can be clicked to access its details, offering an interactive and visual workflow.

### Features on Views

| Feature | Description |
