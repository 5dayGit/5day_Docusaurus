# Intro to Space

Spaces are the second level in the 5day.io structure, sitting within a Workspace. They act as containers for Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks, allowing you to organize work by department, team, or specific focus area. Spaces help you streamline collaboration and manage distinct areas of your organization efficiently.

For example, within a Workspace representing your organization, you might create Spaces for departments like “Marketing,” “Engineering,” or “HR.” Each Space can then house relevant Projects and tasks tailored to that department’s goals.

**Quick Note**
When you create a Workspace, you can start adding Spaces immediately. Each Space is independent within its Workspace, and data like tasks or reports cannot be shared between Spaces.

## Why is Space Important?

A Space can help you:

 - Organize Projects and tasks by team, department, or objective.
 - Provide clarity by separating unrelated workstreams.
 -  Enable focused collaboration within specific areas of your Workspace.

## Key Features of Spaces

**Project Grouping**: House multiple Projects under a single Space for better organization.

**Customized Access**: Assign team members to specific Spaces with defined roles (e.g., Viewer, Editor).

**Navigation**: Easily switch between Spaces within a Workspace using the sidebar.
