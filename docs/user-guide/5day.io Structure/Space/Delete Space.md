# Delete Space

Space organizes Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks within a Workspace. 
Deleting a Space removes it and all its associated data, such as Projects and Tasks, from the Workspace. This action is permanent and should be performed with caution.

## Permission Set


## Delete Space
There are two main ways to initiate the deletion of a Space

| Method | Navigation Path | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Workspace Settings | Workspace -> Spaces -> List of Spaces -> More Menu -> Delete| Delete from the central list of all Spaces within a Workspace |
| Space View | Space List or Board View -> More Menu (⋮) beside Space name -> Delete | Quick access for directly deleting a specific Space. |

### Deletion Process

When you select the Delete option, the following steps occur:

**Confirmation Prompt**: You will be prompted to confirm the deletion to prevent accidental data loss.

**Permission Check**: Only users with ‘Delete permissions’ for the Space can delete it.

**Data Removal**: All associated Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks within the Space are permanently deleted.

**Quick Note**
Deleting a Space is irreversible. Ensure you back up any critical data before proceeding. 
If you need to preserve specific Projects or Tasks, consider moving them to another Space first.  For more details refer [Move Project](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/project/Move%20Project.md).
