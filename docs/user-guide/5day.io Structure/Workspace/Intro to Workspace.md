# Intro to Workspace

Workspace is at the highest level of the 5day.io structure. Spaces, projects, task and subtasks all reside within your workspace. 
It serves as the foundation of any organization's structure, supporting businesses of all sizes. 
You can define and manage various verticals, geographical locations, and other relevant categories in a highly efficient way using workspaces.

For example, if we consider an account as your organization, there will be multiple departments there. These can be your workspaces.

But, if you are a small organization, simply and directly create one workspace and start managing your work.

In addition to the above, a default workspace will be created automatically with the name ‘Your Account Name’ when you enter the system.

Then, depending on your subscription plan, permissions you can manage workspaces in account.

Note: Every workspace is independent and separate from others, so viewing or transferring information between them is not possible.

## **Why is a Workspace Important?**

A workspace can help you:

 - Manage multiple projects on a single page.
 - Avoid missing trivial or crucial information.
 - Manage different departments or working areas independently.

## Key Features of Workspace

**Work Organization:** Group multiple projects under a single workspace.

**Centralized Data:** Dashboards, documents, tasks, and reports are centric to workspace.
