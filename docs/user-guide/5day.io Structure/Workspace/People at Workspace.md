# People at Workspace

**People at Workspace** lets you control exactly who can see and work inside a specific Workspace. Invite or add team members once here - they instantly get access to projects in this Workspace (based on their role and associated permission).

**Why manage people at Workspace level?**

-   One invite = access to current **and future** projects in this Workspace
-   Keep departments separate
-   Remove someone once = they lose access to everything in this Workspace

## Who can Manage

You need **Edit Workspace** permission to invite, add, or remove people.

## Access People at Workspace

1.  Go to Workspace -> More Icon (three dots) -> **Workspace Settings** -> **People**
2.  You’ll see the **full list of everyone** in this Workspace.

## Available Actions

 - Invite People - Type email -> pick role -> Send Invite
 - Add People - Search existing account users -> click + Add
 - Search/Filter People - Type name, email address, or role -> list updates instantly
 - Sort People - By name, email address, role, status.
 - Remove from Workspace - Click more icon (three dots) next to name -> Remove from workspace -> confirm

**Quick Note**

-   **Workspace Owner** can **never** be removed - transfer ownership first (via Edit Workspace)
-   **Project Owners** in this Workspace can’t be removed until their project ownership is transferred
-   Removing someone from Workspace = **instantly blocks** them from all projects inside.
-   They keep access to other Workspaces they’re in.
