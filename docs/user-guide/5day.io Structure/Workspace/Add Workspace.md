## Workspace Details

While creating a workspace, following information is needed:
| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| Icon & Color | Choose a representative icon and color to visually distinguish your workspace |
| Name | Provide a clear and meaningful name of your  workspace |

The **user who creates the workspace** automatically becomes the **owner** of that workspace.

Ownership can later be updated through the **Edit Workspace**, if needed.

The newly created workspace will be visible in the **Workspace List** view.

You can edit, or delete the workspace based on your assigned **role and permissions**.

To modify the workspace, refer [Edit Workspace](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Workspace/Edit%20Workspace.md).

To explore all workspaces, refer [List of Workspace](https://github.com/5dayGit/5day_Docusaurus/blob/main/docs/user-guide/5day.io%20Structure/Workspace/Edit%20Workspace.md).
