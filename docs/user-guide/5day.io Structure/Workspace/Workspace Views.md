# Workspace Views

The Workspace View provides a centralized interface to access and manage all Projects, organized within their respective Spaces and Workspaces.

Available to all accounts regardless of subscription plan.

Workspace View offers two display options - List View and Board View - to suit different workflow preferences. This guide explains how to access and use these views to navigate, organize, and customize your Workspace data.

## Access Workspace View

To access the Space Views, follow these steps:

 1. After Login -> Navigate to Projects: Click the Project icon in the primary panel.
 2. Select View Type (Secondary Panel)
	 - Project Views: Displays Projects in a flat list or board, grouped by workspace.
	 - Structure View: Displays a list of all Workspaces in the secondary panel, with the hierarchy data (Spaces, Projects, Sections, Tasks, Subtasks) of the first Workspace loaded in the Right Panel
3. Structure View -> You will be redirected to a list of all Projects of 1st workspace of your account, organized by their hierarchy (Space > Project).
4. Load Workspace Views: Upon selecting a Workspace in Structure View, the Right Panel will load the Workspace View, with **List View** as the default

## Workspace Views

Workspace Views offer two display modes: List View and Board View. 
Both views provide identical functionality, differing only in their visual presentation.

### List View
List View displays Projects in a structured, hierarchical list within the selected workspace. Each Project is accessible with a single click, providing a clear and compact overview.

### Board View

Board View presents Projects as visual cards on a Kanban-style board within the selected workspace. Each card represents a Project and can be clicked to access its details, offering an interactive and visual workflow.

### Features on Views

| Feature | Description |
|--|--|
| Add |  Add a new space or project directly from the view. Click the “+ Add” icon next to the Space. Refer: Add Project Guide |
