# Delete Space

In 5day.io, a Workspace is the highest level of organization, containing Spaces, Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks. Deleting a Workspace removes it and all its associated data, including all Spaces and their contents, from your account. This action is permanent and should be performed with caution.

### Deletion Process

When you select the Delete option, the following steps occur:

 - **Confirmation Prompt**: You will be prompted to confirm the deletion to prevent accidental data loss.
 - **Permission Check**: Only users with ‘Delete Workspace permission’ can perform this action.
 - **Data Removal**: All associated Spaces, Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks within the Workspace are permanently deleted.

**Quick Note**
Deleting a Workspace is irreversible. Ensure you back up any critical data before proceeding. If you need to preserve specific Spaces or Projects, consider moving them to another Workspace first. For more details refer Move Project.
