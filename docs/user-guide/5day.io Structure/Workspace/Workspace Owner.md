# Workspace Owner
**Workspace Owner** is the single person with ultimate control over the entire Workspace - think of them as the captain who can steer, rename, transfer, or even delete the ship.

## Who can Manage

Only the **current Workspace Owner** or **account-level admins** can change ownership.

## How to Access

1.  Go to your Workspace -> More icon (three dots) -> **Workspace Settings** -> **General**
2.  Scroll to **Workspace Owner** section -> you’re now in the owner panel

## Actions can be performed

| Action | Details |
|--|--|
| View Current Owner | See photo, full name, and email (read-only) |
| Change Owner | Transfer full control to another eligible team member |

**Quick Notes**
-   **Only current owner or account-level admins** can change the owner
-   **New owner must already be in the Workspace** with **Edit Workspace** permission
-   **Dropdown only shows eligible users** - no invalid picks, no mistakes
-   **Transfer is instant** - old owner immediately becomes a regular member (unless removed separately)
-   New owner gets full rights: rename, delete, manage people, everything.
