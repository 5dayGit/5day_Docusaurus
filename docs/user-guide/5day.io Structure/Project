**Projects in 5day.io**

**Overview**

Projects in 5day.io are how you organize and manage a group of tasks that are part of a larger goal, initiative, or deliverable. Every task you create belongs to a project, making it easier to group related work, assign responsibilities, and track progress in one central place.

Use projects to:

- Group related tasks under one initiative.
- Set timelines with project start and end dates.
- Track progress using different views such as List or Board.
- Collaborate with your team using files, and discussions.
- Get visibility into all task-level details without losing sight of the big picture.

Each project supports additional metadata like project description, client assignment (if enabled), tags, custom fields, and moreâ€”so your team has all the context in one place.

âœ… Projects form the foundation for execution in 5day.io. Whether you're launching a new product, running a client engagement, or managing an internal sprint, it all starts with creating a project.

**Subscription Association: Projects**

The **Projects** feature is available across all subscription plans in 5day.io. However, the number of projects you can create depends on your subscription tier:

**Project Creation Limits by Subscription Plan**

| **Subscription Plan** | **Project Creation Limit** |

**Who Can Create and Manage Projects**

- **Account Owners, Account Admins, and Managers (default roles)** can create, access, and manage projects.

âœ… Project creation access is controlled through role-based permissions in **Security & Permissions**.
