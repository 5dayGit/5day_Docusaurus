## **Section**
### **Overview**
Section in 5day.io are a flexible way to organize and group tasks within a project. Think of Section as **virtual containers** that help you categorize your work according to your team’s needs.

For example:

- In a **product roadmap**, Section might represent quarters (Q1, Q2, etc.).
- In a **marketing campaign**, Section might be grouped by months or milestones.
- For **client projects**, Section could be phases like Planning, Execution, and Delivery.
### **Key Features of Section:**
- **Group Tasks Logically**: Section help you break down your project into meaningful segments. You can easily move tasks into Section or assign them to a Section while creating or editing the task.
- **Section-Specific Views**: Each Section has its own dedicated space where you can view all tasks under that Section—similar to how you'd manage at the project level.
- **Independent Views and Controls**: Within a Section, you can access:
  - **List View & Board View**: Just like at the project level, tasks in a Section are displayed as a structured list or a card-based board.
  - **Dashboard**: Each Section can have its own mini-dashboard to track progress and performance.
  - **Search, Filter, Sort, Group By & Customize**: All the same options you have at the project level are available at the Section level, making it easy to drill down and manage tasks effectively.
- **Section Actions**: Similar to projects, Section have their own set of actions like editing, renaming, and deleting.

✅ **Pro Tip:** Section help keep your projects tidy and make it easier to focus on specific parts of a project without distraction from unrelated tasks.
