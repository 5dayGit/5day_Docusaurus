# Line Chart

A Line Chart is a graphical representation that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight lines.

It is useful for tracking changes over periods of time or comparing different sets of related data such as time entries, tasks, and subtasks.

Line Charts help users monitor trends, performance, and project progress through continuous data visualization.

The chart highlights patterns in project timelines, logged hours, and task updates.

### Configuration of Line Chart

The Line Chart configuration is divided into two primary categories for setup:

-   Task: Visualizes task-related data.
-   Timesheet: Focuses on timesheet entries and time-related data.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the configuration settings for both charts:

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Based On** | Task and Subtask | Defines the dataset on which the line chart will be produced. This can include both tasks and subtasks. |
| **Include Subtask** | Yes/No | Determines if subtasks should be included in the chart data. If selected, subtasks will be considered in the widget. |
| **Group By** | X-Axis (e.g. Date, User, Status etc.) | Defines the X-Axis on which the data will be plotted (e.g., by task status, assigned user, or date). |
| **Measure** | Sum, Min, Max, Avg of Estimation, Logged Hours, Story Points, Task ID | Defines how the data will be aggregated on the Y-Axis. Users can choose between Sum, Minimum, Maximum, or Average. |
| **Sort** | Label, Value | Defines how the data should be sorted. Users can choose to sort based on the X-axis or Y-axis values. |
| **Order By** | Ascending, Descending | Specifies the order in which the chart data should be displayed, either in ascending or descending order. |

**Format of Line Chart**
