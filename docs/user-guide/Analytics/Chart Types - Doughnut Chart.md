# Doughnut Chart

A Doughnut Chart is a variation of a Pie Chart where the center is cut out, creating a doughnut-like shape.

A Chart represents the proportion of tasks, logged hours, or time entries, making it easier to visualize parts of a whole.

The chart offers a clear and aesthetic way to show distributions while allowing additional information to be displayed at the center if needed.

It provides insights into how work is divided across users, statuses, projects, or other categories.

## Subscription Association

### Configuration of Doughnut Chart

The Doughnut Chart configuration is divided into two primary categories for setup:

-   Task: Visualizes task-related data.
-   Timesheet: Focuses on timesheet entries and time-related data.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the configuration settings for both charts:

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Based On** | Task and Subtask | Defines the dataset on which the doughnut chart will be produced. This can include both tasks and subtasks. |
| **Include Subtask** | Yes/No | Determines if subtasks should be included in the chart data. If selected, subtasks will be considered in the widget. |
| **Group By** | Category (e.g. User, Status, dates etc.) | Defines how the data will be grouped into different segments of the doughnut. |
| **Measure** | Sum, Count of Estimation, Logged Hours, Story Points, Task ID | Defines how the size of each segment will be calculated. Users can choose between Sum or Count based on the selected field. |
| **Sort** | Label, Value | Defines how the segments should be ordered, either by label (name) or value (size). |
| **Order By** | Ascending, Descending | Specifies the order in which segments are displayed in the chart. |

**Format of Doughnut Chart**

The Format settings let you tweak how the Doughnut Chart looks and grabs attention. Play with it to highlight big slices or keep the whole thing neat.

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Show Tooltip** | Yes/No | Turn on to see a pop-up with exact values when you hover over a slice. |
| **Legend Position** | None/Top/Bottom/Left/Right | Choose where the legend (color labels) sits around the doughnut. |
| **Color Picker** | Color Selection | Pick custom colors for each slice—make important ones stand out or match your team colors. |
