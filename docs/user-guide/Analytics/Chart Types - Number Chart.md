# Number Chart

A Number Chart is a simple, focused visualization that displays a single key metric as a prominent number.

A Chart is used to highlight important values such as total tasks, hours logged, completed story points, or any critical project metric.

It provides a quick snapshot of important data without requiring detailed analysis, helping users monitor KPIs at a glance.

The Number Chart emphasizes clarity and simplicity, making it ideal for dashboards focused on metrics.

### Configuration of Number Chart

The Number Chart configuration is divided into two primary categories for setup:

-   Task: Visualizes task-related data.
-   Timesheet: Focuses on timesheet entries and time-related data.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the configuration settings for both charts:

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Based On** | Task and Subtask | Defines the dataset on which the number will be produced. This can include both tasks and subtasks. |
| **Include Subtask** | Yes/No | Determines if subtasks should be included in the chart data. If selected, subtasks will be considered in the widget. |
| **Measure** | Sum, Min, Max, Avg, Count of Estimation, Logged Hours, Story Points, Task ID | Defines the calculation method for the number shown. Users can choose aggregation based on their focus (e.g., total hours, number of tasks). |
| **Label** | Text input | Defines the label that will be displayed alongside the number to explain what the number represents. |

**Format of Number Chart**

The Format settings let you control how the Number Chart looks and hits home. Tweak it to make the big number pop or keep it simple.

|--|--|--|
| **Color Picker** | Color Selection | Pick the color for the number and label—make it bold for alerts or calm for regular stats. |
