# Resize Widget

The Resize Widget feature allows you to adjust the size of widgets to better fit your data visualization needs.

To resize a widget:

1.  Enable **Edit** mode by clicking the **Edit Dashboard** option.
2.  Hover over the widget you want to resize.
3.  Drag the edges or corners of the widget to expand or collapse its size.
4.  Release once you achieve the preferred size. The new size will be **auto-saved** immediately.

**Quick Note**
Resizing is helpful for creating a cleaner and more organized dashboard, highlighting larger charts or minimizing widgets that require less space.
