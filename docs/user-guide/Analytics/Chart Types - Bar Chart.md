# Bar Chart

A **Bar Chart** is a graphical representation used to compare data across different categories.

A Chart can visually represent the tasks and subtasks, time entries allowing users to analyze and compare data based on task completion, time logged, or other key metrics.

The chart uses rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the value they represent, offering insights into project progress, time allocation, and task-related data.

## **Subscription Association**

The Bar Chart is **available across all subscription plans**.

### Configuration of Bar Chart

The Bar Chart configuration is divided into two primary categories for setup:

-   **Task**: Visualizes task-related data.
-   **Timesheet**: Focuses on timesheet entries and time-related data.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the configuration settings for both charts:
| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Based On** | Task and Subtask | Defines the dataset on which the bar chart will be produced. This can include both tasks and subtasks. |
| **Include Subtask** | Yes/No | Determines if subtasks should be included in the chart data. If selected, subtasks will be considered in the widget. |
| **Group By** | X-Axis (e.g. Date, User, Status etc.) | Defines the X-Axis on which the data will be plotted (e.g., by task status, assigned user, or date). |
| **Measure** | Sum, Min, Max, Avg of Estimation, Logged Hours, Story Points, Task ID | Defines how the data will be aggregated on the Y-Axis. Users can choose between Sum, Minimum, Maximum, or Average. |
| **Sort** | Label, Value | Defines how the data should be sorted. Users can choose to sort based on the X-axis or Y-axis values. |
| **Order By** | Ascending, Descending | Specifies the order in which the chart data should be displayed, either in ascending or descending order. |

**Format of Bar Chart**

The Format settings let you tweak how the Bar Chart looks and feels. Make it match your style or highlight what matters most.

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Show Tooltip** | Yes/No | Turn this on to see a quick pop-up with exact numbers when you hover over a bar. |
| **Legend Position** | None/Top/Bottom/Left/Right | Pick where the legend (the little labels explaining colors) sits on the chart. |
| **Orientation** | Vertical/Horizontal | Choose if bars run up-down (columns) or left-right whichever fits your data better. |
| **Color Picker** | Color selection | Click to pick any color for the bars. Make key categories stand out or match your team branding. |
