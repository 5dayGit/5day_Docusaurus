# Overview of Dashboard
Each **Project** and **Section** inside 5day.io has a dedicated Dashboard view where users can track important data points through customizable widgets.

The Dashboard is configurable based on the project settings and helps teams monitor progress, tasks, timelines, and more without navigating away from the project.

Users can add multiple widgets within a dashboard to create personalized, dynamic views.
