# Overview of Dashboard

The **Dashboard** in 5day.io acts as a powerful visual workspace that brings together key project and section-level insights in one view.

Each **Project** and **Section** inside 5day.io has a dedicated Dashboard view where users can track important data points through customizable widgets.

The Dashboard is configurable based on the project settings and helps teams monitor progress, tasks, timelines, and more without navigating away from the project.

Users can add multiple widgets within a dashboard to create personalized, dynamic views.

## Why is Dashboard Important

The Dashboard is the command center of your project. It eliminates scattered data across tabs, emails, or spreadsheets by surfacing real-time metrics exactly where decisions are made.

-   **Instant clarity**: See project health, upcoming deadlines, and workload distribution at a glance- reducing status meetings by up to 40 %.
-   **Proactive risk detection**: Spot overdue tasks, blocked dependencies, or budget overruns before they escalate.
-   **Team alignment**: Every stakeholder - from PMs to executives - views the same live truth, fostering accountability and faster iterations.
-   **Focus over noise**: Filter out irrelevant details and highlight only the KPIs that drive your delivery cycles.
