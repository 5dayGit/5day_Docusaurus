# Overview of Widget

A **Widget** is a customizable building block used inside a Dashboard to display specific project or section related information in a visual format.
  
Widgets help users quickly monitor progress, track key metrics, and analyse important project activities without navigating through detailed pages.

Each widget can be configured to show task lists, timelines, status charts, workload summaries, and many more.
  
Widgets provide real-time, dynamic data updates based on the project or section activities.
  
Users can add multiple widgets to a single Dashboard, creating a personalized workspace for better decision-making.

## Key features of Widget

**Widget type**: Choose from line chart, bar chart, doughnut chart, pie chart, number chart, or table. You can set up each one to show the exact data you need.

**Filters**: Narrow down what shows up - like only tasks for specific person, certain statuses, or due date range.

**Custom Layout**: Switch colors, flip between list or graph.

**Refresh**: Widgets update live as things change, or hit the refresh button if you want the latest right now.

**Subscription limits**: Add as many widgets as your plan allows; upgrade if you need more.
