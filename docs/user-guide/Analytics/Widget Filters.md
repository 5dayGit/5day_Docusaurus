# Widget Filters

In 5day.io, every widget supports the ability to filter data based on your specific requirements.

Filters help users to refine and customize the information displayed in charts and reports, making it easier to focus on particular section, users, statuses, dates, or any other data points available in the system.

Filters are flexible and can be applied across all widgets - Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Doughnut Chart, Number Chart, and Table View.

## Key Highlights

-   Filters can be applied based on **any field** in 5day.io.
-   Multiple filters can be combined to create complex conditions.
-   Filters are dynamic and can be modified anytime without changing the underlying data.
-   The widget refreshes instantly to reflect the filtered dataset.

## Apply Filter

1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard** from Project Views.
2.  Create a new widget or edit an existing one.
3.  In the widget configuration panel, locate the **Filters** section.
4.  Click on **Add Filter**.
5.  Select any available field offered by 5day.io (e.g., Section, Assignee, Status, Date, Logged Hours, Tags, Custom Fields, etc.).
6.  Define the filter condition (e.g., equals, contains, greater than, less than, between, etc.).
7.  To add more conditions, click **+ Add Filter** again.
8.  After configuring the filters, click **Create Widget/Update Widget** to apply them to your widget.

The widget will now display the data according to the applied filters.
