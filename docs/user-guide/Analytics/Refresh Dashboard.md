# Refresh Dashboard
Refreshing ensures that your dashboard displays the most up-to-date information from your projects and sections.

5day.io offers two ways to refresh the dashboard:

**Full Dashboard Refresh:** Refresh the entire dashboard at once, updating all widgets simultaneously with the latest data.

**Individual Widget Refresh:** Hover over a specific widget to reveal the **Refresh** icon.

Clicking this icon will refresh only that widget, allowing you to update individual components without reloading the whole dashboard.
