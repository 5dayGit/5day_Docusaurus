## Task Widgets
Task Widgets allow you to visualize the status, progress, and distribution of tasks within a project or section.  

These widgets help you track overdue tasks, monitor task priorities, view completion rates, and many more.  

You can use various chart types like Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Line Charts, doughnut Charts, Number Charts and Table views.

Bar Chart for Tasks: Displays task data using horizontal or vertical bars to easily compare quantities across different categories.

Line Chart for Tasks: Shows task trends over time by connecting data points with a continuous line, ideal for tracking progress.

Pie Chart for Tasks: Represents task distribution as slices of a circle, helping visualize proportions of different statuses or priorities.

Doughnut Chart for Tasks: A circular chart similar to a pie chart, but with a hollow center, offering a cleaner look for task breakdowns.

Number Chart for Tasks: Highlights a key metric as a single, bold number — like total tasks, completed tasks, or overdue tasks.

Table view for Tasks: Organizes task details in a structured table format for easy sorting, filtering, and comparison.
