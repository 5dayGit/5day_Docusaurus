# Pie Chart

A Pie Chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.

A Chart represents task distributions, logged hours, or time entries in a visual, percentage-based format.

It helps users quickly understand the breakdown of different segments, such as project tasks or user contributions, at a glance.

Each slice of the pie represents a category's contribution relative to the total dataset.

### Configuration of Pie Chart

The Pie Chart configuration is divided into two primary categories for setup:

-   Task: Visualizes task-related data.
-   Timesheet: Focuses on timesheet entries and time-related data.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the configuration settings for both charts:

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Based On** | Task and Subtask | Defines the dataset on which the pie chart will be produced. This can include both tasks and subtasks. |
| **Include Subtask** | Yes/No | Determines if subtasks should be included in the chart data. If selected, subtasks will be considered in the widget. |
| **Group By** | Category (e.g. User, Status, Project, etc..) | Defines how the data will be grouped into different slices of the pie. |
| **Measure** | Sum, Count of Estimation, Logged Hours, Story Points, Task ID | Defines how the size of each pie slice will be calculated. Users can choose between Sum or Count based on the selected field. |
| **Sort** | Label, Value | Defines how the slices should be ordered, either by label (name) or value (size). |
| **Order By** | Ascending, Descending | Specifies the order in which slices are displayed in the chart. |

**Format of Pie Chart**

The Format settings let you shape how the Pie Chart looks and pops. Tweak it to spotlight key slices or fit your vibe.

| Field Name | Settings | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **Show Tooltip** | Yes/No | Turn on to see a pop-up with exact values when you hover over a slice. |
| **Legend Position** | None/Top/Bottom/Left/Right | Choose where the legend (color labels) sits around the pie. |
