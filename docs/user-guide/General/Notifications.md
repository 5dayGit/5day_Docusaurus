# Notifications

Notifications in [5day.io](http://5day.io/) help you stay updated on everything important across your projects, tasks, timesheets, reminders, and other activities. The notifications panel shows all alerts in one place so you can quickly review updates, mark them as read, or clear them as needed.

Each notification includes relevant details and quick actions that help you stay updated. You can also manage how and where you receive notifications by accessing Notification Settings.
## Subscription Association
Notifications are available for **all subscription plans** of [5day.io](http://5day.io/).
## How to Access Notifications
There are two ways to open Notifications:

1. **Using the Primary Navigation Panel**

Click the **bell icon** on the navigation panel to open your Notifications panel.

2. **Using Hotkeys**

Press **n** on your keyboard to instantly open Notifications from anywhere in [5day.io](http://5day.io/).
## Notifications Panel – Features
The Notifications panel is designed to give users a clean, organized, and actionable way to manage all incoming alerts.

Below are all the available options:
### 1\. View All Notifications or Only Unread
At the top of the notifications panel, you will see two filter options:

- **All**

Displays every notification you have received.

- **Only unread**

Shows only notifications that have not been read or marked as read. This helps you quickly focus on pending updates.
### 2\. Mark a Notification as Read
Each notification has a “Mark as Read” action.

How it works:

- When you **hover over a notification**, a **small circular radio-button style icon** appears.
- Hover tooltip: **“Mark as Read”**
- Clicking the icon immediately marks that notification as **read**.
- The notification will no longer appear in the "Only unread" filter.

This helps you keep your panel clean and acknowledge updates without clearing them.
### 3\. Clear (Delete) a Notification
Next to each notification, a **Clear (x)** icon appears on hover.

- Hover tooltip: **“Clear Notification”**
- Clicking this removes the notification from your panel permanently.

Use this when the notification is no longer required.
### 4\. Clear All Notifications
At the top-right corner of the panel, you will see the option:

**Clear All**

Clicking this will remove **all** notifications from your account in one action.
### 5\. Notification Details
Each notification card displays:

- Notification title (e.g., **Remind Your Team to Log Timesheet**)
- The user or system that triggered the notification
- Additional details (task mentioned, task details, task updates, etc.)
- Timestamp indicating **when** the notification was generated
## Notification Settings
A gear icon is available on the Notifications panel. Clicking this icon opens the Notification Settings page, where you can control how notifications are configured for your own account. Each user can manage their notification preferences independently.
#### Note
- Clearing or marking notifications as read does not affect project data—it only updates your personal notification center.
