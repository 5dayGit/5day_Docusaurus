# Global Search
## Overview
Global Search helps you quickly find anything within your [5day.io](http://5day.io/) account—tasks, projects, and users—without navigating through multiple workspaces or menus.

It provides a unified search panel so you can type a keyword and instantly locate relevant items across the entire system.

Global Search is especially useful when you manage multiple projects and need to jump to a task or project quickly. You can also use it to look up users and view their details.
## How to Access Global Search
There are two ways to open Global Search:

1. **Using the Search Icon** 
   1. On the left navigation panel, click the **Search** icon.
   1. A search panel will open on the right side of the screen.
1. **Using the Hotkey** 
   1. Press **s** on your keyboard from anywhere in [5day.io](http://5day.io/) to open Global Search instantly.
## How Global Search Works
When you open Global Search:

1. **Only the search bar is visible initially.**
1. **You must type at least two characters** for the search to begin.
1. Once results are available, **the category tabs appear automatically**: 
   1. **All**
   1. **Task**
   1. **Project**
   1. **User**

These tabs allow you to refine the scope of your search after results are displayed.
### Typing Your Search Keyword
- Enter at least **two characters** for the search to start.
- Results refresh automatically as soon as you meet the minimum character requirement.
