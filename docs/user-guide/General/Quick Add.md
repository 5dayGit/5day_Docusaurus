# **Overview**

**Quick Add** is a feature in 5day.io that lets you swiftly create core entities—like workspaces, projects, sections, tasks, time entries, and reminders—without navigating away from your current screen. It enhances productivity by centralizing all creation actions into a single, easy-to-access drawer.

Access to each option in Quick Add is determined by the user’s **permission settings**. Only the items a user has permission to create will be visible.

## **How to Access Quick Add**
To open Quick Add:

1. Navigate to the **menu** bar.
1. Click the **“+ Add” icon**.
1. You can also use the shortcut Shift + Q to instantly open Quick Add.

This will open the Quick Add drawer from the left, displaying all creation options available to the user.

## **What You Can Create with Quick Add**
Depending on your assigned permissions, you may be able to create the following:

- **Workspace** – Create a new workspace.
- **Space** – Add a space within a workspace to categorize related projects.
- **Project** – Start a new project under a selected space.
- **Section** – Create a section within a project to organize tasks.
- **Task** – Add a new task.
- **Time Entry** – Log hours manually for a task.
- **Reminder** – Set up a personal or task-linked reminder with a defined date and time.

**Note:**\
The options displayed in the Quick Add panel are **permissions-based**. If an item is not visible (e.g., “Create Workspace” or “Add Reminder”), it means the user does not currently have permission to perform that action.
