# **Data Import**
## **Overview**
In 5day.io, the **Data Import** feature allows users to **import people and tasks in bulk** to save time and streamline onboarding or migration from other systems.\
Whether you're importing 10 users or 100, or migrating large task lists into projects — the process is simple, efficient, and trackable.

## **What Can Be Imported?**
- **People Import**: Add multiple users at once into your organization.
- **Task Import**: Bulk upload tasks into specific projects.
