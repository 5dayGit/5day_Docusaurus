**Who can Manage Account Profile?**

In 5day.io, access to the **Account Profile** is tightly controlled to maintain security and prevent unauthorized changes at the organization level.

Here’s how access is managed:
## **By Default Access**
- **Account Owners**  and Account Admin with the default system role have **full access** to the Account Profile.
- They can **view and manage** all sections including Profile and Display settings.
- No other roles  (Manager, Member, External Member, Guest) are allowed to access Account Profile by default.

## **Access via Custom Roles and Permissions**
If your organization uses **Custom Roles** in 5day.io, access to the Account Profile can be configured through **Global Permissions**.

Within the **Global Permission** settings:

- Under the **Account Settings** category, you will find three options:
  - **None** – User cannot view or access account profile.
  - **View** – User can only view the Account Profile (read-only access).
  - **Manage** – User can fully manage and update the Account Profile.

✅ **If a user’s custom role has "Manage" permission enabled under Account Settings**, they will be able to:

- Access the Account Profile
- Edit Account Profile details (Account Name, Country, Description, Logo, etc.)
- Edit Display settings (Time Zone, Language, Layout, Theme, etc.)
