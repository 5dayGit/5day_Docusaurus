**Account Profile**

The **Account Profile** section in 5day.io is where the **Account Owner** (or Admins with appropriate permissions) can manage the organisation account level information and can configure how the 5day.io environment looks and behaves for all users across the organization.\
When a user logs in as an **Account Owner**, they can access the Account Profile to configure essential details that define the identity, preferences, and appearance of their 5day.io account.

The Account Profile is divided into **two main sections**:

- **Profile**
- **Display**

Each section allows the Account Owner to control different aspects of the account’s setup.
