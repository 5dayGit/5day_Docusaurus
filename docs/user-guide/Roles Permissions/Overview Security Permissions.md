# **Overview of Security and Permissions in 5day.io**
The **Security and Permissions** section in 5day.io allows organizations to **control access** and **manage user roles** across the platform.

Through this section, users can:

- **View Default Roles** provided by the system, such as:
  - Account Owner
  - Account Admin
  - Manager
  - Member
  - External Member
  - Guest
- **Review Role Permissions**\
  For each role, users can see a **granular breakdown** of what access is granted, categorized into:
  - **Global Permissions** – Access to core administrative areas like Account Settings, People Management, Billing, Security, Integrations, and Templates.
  - **Feature Permissions** – Access to day-to-day work areas like Workspaces, Projects, Sections, Tasks, Timesheets, Discussions, and Files.
- **Create and Manage Custom Roles**\
  Organizations on eligible plans (e.g., Growth Plan) can go beyond default roles and **create Custom Roles** tailored to their own permission requirements.\
  This allows fine-grained control over who can view, add, edit, delete, or perform special actions (like moving tasks or approving timesheets) across different modules.

## **Subscription Association**
The **Roles and Permissions** feature is available across all subscription plans in 5day.io.\
However, the ability to **create Custom Roles** depends on your subscription plan.

|**Subscription Plan**|**Roles Available**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Free Plan|Access to **Default Roles** only: Account Owner, Account Admin, Manager, Member, External Member, Guest.|
|Growth Plan|Access to both **Default Roles** and the ability to **create Custom Roles** as needed.|
