## **How to Edit Default and Custom Roles**
In 5day.io, you can edit both **default roles** (like Manager, Member, Guest) and **custom roles** you've created to tailor access and permissions.
### **Steps to Edit a Role:**
1. Go to **Account Settings**.
1. Click on **Security & Permissions** from the sidebar.
1. Under the **Roles & Permissions** section:
   1. You will see a list of all **Default Roles** provided by the system.
   1. You will also see a list of all **Custom Roles** created in your account.
1. Click on the role you want to edit.
1. Inside the role:
   1. Update the **Global Permissions** (e.g., access to account settings, billing, integrations).
   1. Update the **Feature Permissions** (e.g., view, add, edit, delete rights for tasks, projects, discussions, etc.).

✅ All changes you make are **automatically saved** — no need to click a save button.
