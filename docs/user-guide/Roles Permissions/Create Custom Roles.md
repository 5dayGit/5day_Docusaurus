# **How to Create Custom Roles**
Custom Roles in 5day.io allow you to define tailored access levels for different types of users, beyond the system-provided default roles.\
*Note: Custom Roles are available only on the Growth Plan.*

## **Create a Custom Role**
1. Navigate to **Account Settings**.
   ### IMAGE
1. Click on **Security & Permissions** from the sidebar.
1. Scroll down to the **Custom Roles** section.
1. Click on the **+ Add** button to create a new role.
   ### IMAGE
1. A pop-up box will appear asking for two details:
   1. **Role Name**: Enter a name for the new role (e.g., Team Lead, Project Reviewer).
   1. **Description** (optional): Add a brief description explaining the purpose of this role.
1. After entering the required details, click **Create**.

✅ Once created, the new role will appear under the **Custom Roles** list.

## **Assign Permissions to the Custom Role**
After creating a role, you need to define its permissions.

1. Click on the newly created role from the **Custom Roles** list.
   ### IMAGE
1. You will now see two permission sections:
   1. **Global Permissions**: Configure account-wide access such as Account Settings, People Management, etc.
   1. **Feature Permissions**: Configure specific permissions related to Workspaces, Projects, Tasks, Discussions, Files, etc.
1. For each permission area:
   1. Choose the appropriate level (Manage, View, None for Global Permissions).
   1. Choose View/Add/Edit/Delete/Other settings for Feature Permissions.
1. Any changes you make are **automatically saved** — no Save button is needed.

✅ Your custom role is now fully configured and ready to assign to users!

**Note:**
- **Creating the role** (Name + Description) and **assigning permissions** are treated as two clean steps.
- **Auto-save** ensures your changes are instantly applied.
- Custom Roles give you complete flexibility in managing how users work inside 5day.io.



## **Create a Custom Role via the Duplicate Option**
In addition to creating a custom role from scratch, 5day.io also allows you to create a custom role by duplicating an existing one.\
This is useful when you want to create a new role with similar permissions to an existing role, and just make minor changes.
### **Steps to Duplicate a Custom Role:**
1. Go to **Account Settings**.
1. Click on **Security & Permissions** from the sidebar.
1. Under the **Roles & Permissions** section, scroll to the **Custom Roles** list.
1. Find the existing role you want to duplicate.
   ### IMAGE
1. Click on the **three-dot menu** (⋮) next to the role.
1. Select **Duplicate** from the menu options.

✅ A new duplicated role will be created immediately with the same permission settings.

###
###
### **Renaming the Duplicated Role:**
1. Click on the newly duplicated role from the list.
   ### IMAGE
1. At the top, you’ll see a **pencil (edit) icon** next to the role name.
1. Click the pencil icon to rename the role and update the description (optional).
1. The system will ask for a confirmation before saving changes.
1. Once confirmed, your duplicated role is successfully updated and ready to use.

### **When to Use This:**
- You want to **recreate a similar role** without manually configuring permissions again.
- You want to **speed up setup** for departments or clients with slightly varied access.
- You’re modeling roles after existing defaults with only minor edits.
