## Timesheet Feature 
### **Overview**
In 5day.io, timesheet-related functionalities such as time entry, tracking, and approval can be configured at the project level based on your team's needs. These features provide flexibility in how you want to manage and track work hours across different types of projects — whether client-based, internal, or billable/non-billable.

By default, the following features are typically enabled:

- **Project Finance** – For tracking billable and non-billable hours, budgets, and profitability.
- **Time Estimates** – To set time estimates per task and manage expected workload.
- **Time Tracking** – To log actual hours spent on tasks manually or via timers.

Additional timesheet features such as **Time Approval**, **Overtime**, and **Assignee Wise Estimation** can be turned on or off as needed.

These settings are only visible to users with permission to manage project settings — typically **Project Managers**, **Account Admins**, or users with custom roles granted access to this section.

### Default Enabled Features
By default, the following timesheet features are turned on in every project:

- **Project Finance** – Track billable, non-billable hours, project budgets, and profitability.
- **Time Estimates** – Set and manage estimated hours for each task.
- **Time Tracking** – Log actual time spent on tasks manually or via timer.

These features offer a solid baseline for basic time management.

### **Optional Features (Enable as Needed)**
The following additional features are available but **disabled by default**. Project Managers or users with permission can enable or disable them at any time using the toggle switches.
#### **✅ Time Approval**
- Enforces a formal approval process for submitted timesheets.
- Once enabled, project managers or approvers must approve time entries before they're finalized.
#### **⏱ Overtime**
- Allows users to log hours worked beyond their regular schedules.
- Useful for capturing extra billable/non-billable time during crunch periods.
####  Assignee-Wise Estimation
- Allows task estimations to be **divided among multiple assignees**.
- Once this feature is enabled, a confirmation prompt appears asking how you’d like the estimation to be handled:
  - **Equally divide the estimation by person**, or
  - **Disable equal division**, allowing manual input of effort per assignee.
