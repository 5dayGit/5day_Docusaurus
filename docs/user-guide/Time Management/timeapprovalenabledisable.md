## **How to Enable or Disable Time Approval for a Project**
### **Steps to Enable or Disable Time Approval**
1. Go to the **project** where you want to update the time approval setting.
1. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the project name and select **Project Settings**.
1. In the left menu, click on **Features**.
1. Locate the toggle for **Time Approval**.

   1. To **enable**: Switch the toggle **ON**. Time Approval will be activated for this project.
   1. To **disable**: Switch the toggle **OFF**. Time entries will no longer require approval.

### **⚠️ Notes**
- Time Approval only works if **Time Tracking** is also enabled for the project.
- Only users with access to **manage project settings** (such as **Admins**, **Project Managers**, or users with the appropriate custom role permissions) can update this setting.
- Once Time Approval is enabled, team members will need to manually **submit** their time entries.
- Approvers will have the ability to **review**, **approve**, **reject**, or **add approved** submitted time logs as needed.
