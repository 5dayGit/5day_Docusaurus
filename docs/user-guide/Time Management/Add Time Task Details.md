# **Add Time via Task Details**
## **Overview**
In 5day.io, users can directly add time for any task from within its **Task Details** view. This method is especially useful when you’re already reviewing or updating a task and want to capture time without switching views.

Within the task, you’ll find two main ways to track your time:

1. **Add Time Manually**
1. **Start a Timer**

Both options are available at the bottom bar of the task details interface.

## **Option 1: Add Time Manually**
### IMAGE
You can log your time manually by clicking the **➕ Add Time** icon in the task details view. This will open the standard **Time Entry Form** in the **Task** tab.

From here, you can:

- Select either **Duration** (drag to set hours) or **Time Range** (enter start and end time)
- Confirm the **Project** and **Task**
- Choose whether the time is **Billable** or **Non-Billable**
- Add any relevant **Notes**
- Click **Add** to save the time entry

## **Option 2: Start Timer**
If you'd rather let the system track time for you:
    ### IMAGE
1. Click the **▶ Start Timer** icon at the bottom of the task
1. The timer begins immediately and will keep running in the background
1. Continue working on your task — the timer remains active as long as the tab is open
1. Once finished, return to the task and click the **■ Stop Timer** button
1. The tracked time will be automatically logged under your name for that task

## **Viewing Logged Time**
After time is logged (whether manually or via timer), you can view all related entries by clicking the **Time Logged** field beside the task’s timer bar. This provides a breakdown of all time tracked for that task, including:

- Date of entry
- Hours and minutes logged
- User who logged the time
- Billable or non-billable time entry
