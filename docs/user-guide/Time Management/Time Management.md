## **Overview**

Time is one of the most valuable resources in any project — and understanding how it’s spent is key to improving productivity, forecasting work, and optimizing team performance.

The **Timesheet Management module** in 5day.io enables teams to **track, manage, and analyze time spent across tasks, projects, and internal activities** — all in one place.

Whether you’re logging time for **client deliverables**, **internal meetings**, or **time off**, the module offers the flexibility to capture it accurately and meaningfully.
