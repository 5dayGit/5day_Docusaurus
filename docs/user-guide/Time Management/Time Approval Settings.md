### **⚠️ Notes**
- Time Approval only works if **Time Tracking** is also enabled for the project.
- Only users with access to **manage project settings** (such as **Admins**, **Project Managers**, or users with the appropriate custom role permissions) can update this setting.
- Once Time Approval is enabled, team members will need to manually **submit** their time entries.
- Approvers will have the ability to **review**, **approve**, **reject**, or **add approved** submitted time logs as needed.
