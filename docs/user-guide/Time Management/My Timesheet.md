## **My Timesheet**
### **Overview**
**My Timesheet** in 5day.io gives every user a centralized view to track their time logged across projects — whether it’s billable hours, internal work, or time off. It’s designed to help both individuals and managers get a clear picture of time utilization and stay aligned on productivity goals.

From this single interface, users can:
  ### IMAGE
- **Log time entries** using the **Add Time** or **Add Bulk Time** buttons
- Switch between multiple views: **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **List**
- **See logged entries by type** – Time Entry, Internal Time, and Time Off
- **Search:** Look up time entries using task or subtask names, task or subtask IDs, or by people.
- **Group data** in List View by **Project** or **Member** to easily understand where time is going

Users can only view and manage their own time entries by default. However, **admins, project managers, or users with permission** can change the "Showing for" dropdown to see entries for a specific member or all members.

In the **List View**, additional flexibility is provided:

- **Group by Project**: View a breakdown of your timesheet entries across each project
- **Group by Member** (for managers): View all entries submitted by each team member

Managers can also access the **Time Approval** tab to review and approve timesheets across different projects, depending on permissions and workspace settings.

Whether you're an individual contributor keeping track of your hours, or a manager reviewing timesheets for approvals — My Timesheet keeps everything organized, clear, and easy to act on.
### **How View Tabs Work in My Timesheet**
  ### IMAGE
The **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **List** tabs in *My Timesheet* work the same way as they do in the **Project Timesheet View**, with one difference:

- In **Project Timesheet**, entries are scoped to that specific project.
- In **My Timesheet**, members can view their own time entries across all projects they are assigned to. Admins, project managers, or users with the appropriate permissions can switch views to see time entries for other members across Day, Week, Month, or List view.

For details on each view (including how to log time, use filters, and read summaries), refer to the [Timesheet View Guide].
