## **How to Approve or Reject Time Entries**
In 5day.io, when time approval is enabled for a project, admins, project managers, or users with the appropriate permissions can **approve** or **reject** time entries submitted by members.

You can manage time approvals in two ways:

###  Option 1: From the Project’s Time Approval Tab
1. Go to the **project** for which you want to review time entries.
1. Click on the **Timesheet** tab in the top menu.
1. Inside Timesheet, switch to the **Time Approval** tab.
1. Use the **Show for** dropdown to filter by a specific team member or select **All Members** to view everyone’s entries.
1. Choose the relevant **week range** using the date navigation.
1. You will now see:
   1. A list of **members**
   1. Each member’s **tasks**
   1. Logged time
1. For each time entry row, you’ll see two icons:
   1. ✅ **Tick** to approve
   1. ❌ **Cross** to reject
1. To approve all time entries for all member, use the **Approve All** button 
###  Option 2: From My Timesheet → Time Approval
1. Click on **My Timesheet** from the navigation bar.
1. Switch to the **Time Approval** tab.
1. Use the **Show for** filter to view:
   1. A specific team member’s time entries
   1. Or **All Members**, if you want to review everyone’s time entry logs
1. Select the desired **week range** using the date navigator.
1. You’ll now see:
   1. Each **project**
   1. Corresponding **Members** & **tasks**
   1. Time logged by **date** under each team member
1. As with the project-level view, each entry row will have:
   1. ✅ A **tick icon** to approve
   1. ❌ A **cross icon** to reject
1. To approve all time entries for all member, use the **Approve All** button

###  Option 3: From Task Details → Total Time Logged
1. Go to the **specific task** in a project.
1. Scroll to the **bottom bar** and click **Total Time Logged**.
1. In the time log popup:
   1. You’ll see a list of entries with **date**, **status**, **logged time**, and an editable **Approved** field.
1. To approve or reject:
   1. Enter the desired approved time (if you want to adjust)
   1. Click ✅ to **approve**
   1. Click ❌ to **reject**
1. This is especially useful for reviewing or modifying individual entries quickly.
### **🔔 Notes**
