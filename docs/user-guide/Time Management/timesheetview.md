## **Timesheet View**
**Overview**

The **Timesheet View** in 5day.io provides a clear, calendar-based overview of all time logged within a project. It helps members and project managers monitor, manage, and analyze time entries across tasks, internal work, and time-off – making time tracking transparent and efficient.

Users can switch between **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, or **List** views to review or log time entries based on their preferred granularity. This view offers visibility into how much time has been logged, by whom, and against which task or internal category.

Key highlights of Timesheet View:

-  **Flexible Time Views**: Toggle between Day, Week, Month, or List views to visualize logged hours.
-  **Add Time Easily**: Use the + Add Time or + Add Bulk Time buttons to log work quickly.
-  **View Time by User**: See your own logged time. Project Managers and Admins can view time logged by other team members.
-  **Click-to-Log Time**: Click or drag across time blocks in Day, Week, or Month views to bring up the Add Time Entry modal and log time directly from the calendar.
-  **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar to find entries by task name, subtask, or people. Apply filters like **Billable** or **Non-Billable** to refine results.
-  **Time Breakdown**: See totals for Billable, Non-Billable, PTO, Overtime, and Utilization for each user.
-  **Supports All Entry Types**: Works seamlessly with task time, internal time, and time-off entries.

This view is particularly useful for managers to audit logged time across the team and for members to ensure their entries are complete and up to date.
