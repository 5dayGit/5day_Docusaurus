### **List View in Timesheet**
The **List View** offers a clean, summary-style breakdown of time entries for the selected week. It’s ideal for getting a quick snapshot of how much time has been logged by each member and across which tasks.
#### **What You Can Do in List View**
- **Member-wise Summary**:
  - Shows each member's name with their total time logged during the selected week.
  - Clicking on a member row expands the list of tasks against which time has been logged.
- **Task Details**:
  - For each user, a detailed list of tasks is shown with individual time logs beside them.
- **View for Different Members**:
  - Members will only see their own time entries.
  - Admins, Project Managers, or users with proper permissions can switch the “Showing for” selector to:
    - A specific member — to view that individual’s data
    - **All Members** — to view all team members in an expandable list format

🔍 Note: When viewing "All Members", the summary section will be hidden.

- **Week Navigation**:
  - The current week is selected by default.
  - Navigate to past or upcoming weeks using the left/right arrow buttons at the top.

- **Search & Filter**:
  - Search: Look up time entries using task or subtask names, task or subtask IDs, or by people.
  - Filter by **Budget Type** (Billable or Non-Billable) using the top-right filter icon.
- **Summary Panel**:
  - A summary at the bottom will display detailed time entry summary.
