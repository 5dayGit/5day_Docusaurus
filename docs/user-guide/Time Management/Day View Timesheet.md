## **Day View (Timesheet)**
The **Day View** in 5day.io Timesheet allows you to see time entries laid out in a familiar hourly calendar format. It’s designed to help you visualize how your team is spending time throughout the day.
###  What You Can See
- A **vertical timeline** from 00:00 to 24:00, showing all hours in a day.
- All **logged time entries** for the selected date appear as blocks on the timeline.
- A **summary section** will be shown.
###  Adding Time Entries
- You can **click and drag** on any time block (e.g., 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM) to log new time.
- This opens the Add **Time Entry pop-up**, where you can enter task, duration, notes, and select billable/non-billable.
