1. In the **task detail panel**, scroll down to the **Time Logged** section.
1. Click on **Time Logged** to open the list of all time entries.
1. Find the **entry you want to edit**.
1. Click on the **✏️ Edit icon** beside that entry.
1. The **Edit Time Entry** form will open.
1. Modify the necessary fields (e.g., date, hours, budget type, note).
1. Click **Update** to save the changes.

✅ **Note**: You can only edit your own entries unless you have the appropriate permissions.
