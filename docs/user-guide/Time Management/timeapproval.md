### **Time Approval Overview**
The **Time Approval** feature in 5day.io allows organizations to implement a manual approval workflow for timesheet entries submitted by team members. When enabled, this feature ensures that all time logs must be reviewed and approved by project managers, admins, or users with the appropriate permission set before they are finalized.

Once time approval is enabled for a project, members can continue logging time against their tasks. However, those entries will remain in a **pending** state until reviewed. Approvers will have the option to **approve** or **reject** individual time entries or approve all entries in bulk for a project or specific member.

Team members can still see the approval status of their entries and resubmit or modify time logs based on feedback, depending on the workspace settings.

This approval process adds a layer of oversight and accuracy to project time tracking—ensuring that only validated hours are included in reports, billing, and utilization.
#### **Key Highlights:**
- Time Approval must be **enabled per project** in Project Settings > Features.
- Only users with the **"Approve Timesheet" permission** (admins, project managers, or custom role users) can approve or reject timesheets.
- **Approvers can manually enter or adjust the approved hours** for each time entry while reviewing it. This is done in the 'Approved' column provided alongside the logged hours for each date. This allows approvers to validate and confirm how much of the submitted time is accepted.
- Members can view their **approval status** and update or resubmit entries if permitted.
- Approved timesheet entries are visible across **My Timesheet** and **Project Timesheet** views for both members and approvers.
