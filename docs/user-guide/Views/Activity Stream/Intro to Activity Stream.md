# Intro to Activity Stream

**Activity Stream** is your live, chronological log of every change across Projects, Sections, Tasks, and Subtasks - showing exactly what happened, who did it, and when. 
It’s like a project diary that auto-updates, so you never miss a beat on what’s moving (or not).

## Why is Activity Stream Important?

-   **Spot issues fast**: See why a task slipped (e.g., “Due date changed by John on Nov 10”)
-   **Build trust**: Prove accountability with a full audit trail for retros or client reviews
-   **Save time**: No digging through emails or chats - everything’s in one searchable spot
-   **Learn & improve**: Track patterns like “Sarah updates status 3x more than average”

## Key Features of Activity Stream

-   **Real-time updates**: Changes appear instantly as they happen
-   **Who/What/When**: Every entry shows user, action (e.g., “Status -> Done”), timestamp
-   **Search & Filter**: By person, date, type (e.g., “Show only Task updates from last week”)
