## **Timesheet Summary Section**
The **Summary Section** in Timesheet View helps users and project managers quickly understand how time is being distributed across different categories and track overall utilization.

This section is available across all Timesheet views — **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **List** — and provides a consistent breakdown of time data regardless of the view.
### **What You’ll See in the Summary:**
#### **Total Hours Panel**
Displays total hours logged and splits them into:

- **Billable**: Time tagged as billable.
- **Non-Billable**: Time that is non-billable.
- **Capacity**: The expected available working hours for that user or member.
- **Missing**: Hours that haven’t been accounted for (Capacity - Logged Hours).
#### **Utilization Panel**
Shows how efficiently time is being used with metrics such as:

- **Utilization %**: (Total Logged / Capacity) × 100
- **Billable %**: (Billable / Capacity) × 100
- **Non-Billable %**
- **Internal**: Internal time entries (like meetings or training)
- **PTO**: Paid time off entries (e.g., sick leave, casual leave)
- **Overtime**: Time logged beyond standard hours (if overtime tracking is enabled)
