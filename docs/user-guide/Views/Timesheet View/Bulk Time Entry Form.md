## **Overview**
The **Bulk Time Entry** feature in 5day.io allows users to log time for multiple days in one go, making it easier to catch up on time tracking for past or future dates. This is especially useful for logging time on recurring tasks or internal activities like meetings, planning, or documentation.

Bulk Time Entry supports both project-based time entries and internal time logging — all within a unified, calendar-style view.
## **How to Access Bulk Time Entry**
You can access the **Bulk Time Entry** form from two locations:

1. **From a Project**
   1. Go to a **Project** where you have access.
   1. Click on the **Timesheet** tab.

## **How Bulk Time Entry Works**
Once you open the Bulk Time Entry modal, you will see:
      ### IMAGE
- A **weekly calendar** view (Monday to Sunday).
- A **user switcher** (visible only if you have rights to log time for others).
- A list of added tasks or internal time categories with **input fields** beside each date.

You can enter time in **hh:mm** format directly into the date fields.

##  Add Task
1. Click **+ Add Task**.
1. Select the **Project** and **Task** for which you want to log time.
1. Click **Add**.

Once added, the task appears as a row in the calendar view, and you can enter time for any day of the week.

## Add Internal Time
1. Click **+ Add Internal Time**.
1. Select the **Workspace** (auto-filled based on context).
1. Choose the **Internal Time Category** (e.g., Meetings, Training).
1. Click **Add**.

The category will be listed with empty time fields next to each day, ready for entry.

ℹ️ Internal time entries are used to capture non-project hours like internal meetings or activities.
