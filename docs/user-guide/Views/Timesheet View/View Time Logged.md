**View Time Logged Entries via Task Details**
## **Overview**
In 5day.io, users can easily view all time entries logged against a task directly from the **Task Details** panel. This allows team members and managers to quickly understand how much time has been spent on a task and by whom.

This view provides a transparent breakdown of contributions and helps in reviewing, managing, or auditing worklogs.

## **How to View Time Entries**
To access time entries from Task Details:

1. Open the task from any project view (List, Board, etc.)
1. Scroll to the **bottom bar** of the task card
1. Click on the **Time Logged** section to open the **Time Entries panel**
