## **Overview of Timesheet View**
The **Timesheet View** in [5day.io](http://5day.io/) allows users to manage, record, and visualize time logged across all their projects in one place. It provides a centralized space for individuals and teams to track working hours, analyze utilization, and ensure accurate time reporting for billable and non-billable work.

Timesheet View offers two main sections — **Timesheet** and **Time Approval** — that appear side by side at the top of the screen.

- **Timesheet** is where users can add, edit, and view their logged hours in multiple time-based layouts such as **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **List**.
- **Time Approval** is available only if the project has timesheet approval enabled. Here, authorized users can review and approve submitted timesheets for their team members.

Each view (Day, Week, Month, and List) presents logged time in a different format to suit different needs. Users can switch between views with a single click, making it easy to see daily breakdowns, weekly summaries, or monthly overviews of time logged across tasks and projects.

Alongside these views, users can search or filter entries based on task name, task ID, member, status, or billable type. This helps refine data visibility and focus on specific details, such as pending approvals or billable time entries.
## **Key Features of Timesheet View:**
The Timesheet View in [5day.io](http://5day.io/) is designed to give users complete control and flexibility when tracking their working hours. It includes essential tools to log, review, and analyze time entries efficiently, ensuring teams stay aligned and accountable.
### **Add Time / Add Bulk Time**
Users can log hours using two simple options:

- **Add Time:** Used to record a single time entry for a specific day.
- **Add Bulk Time:** Allows entering time entries for multiple days in one go.
### **Timesheet**
Users can switch between four distinct views to manage and analyze logged time:
- **Day View:** Displays a detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown of all entries for a single day.
- **Week View:** Provides a summary of time logged for each day of the week.
- **Month View:** Shows total time logged across the entire month.
- **List View:** Presents a detailed table with all logged hours for members within the project.

Each view adapts to different use cases — from daily time tracking to long-term utilization review.
### **Calendar Widget**
The **Calendar Widget** helps users navigate across days, weeks, or months depending on the selected view:

- In **Day View**, users can select a specific date.
- In **Week View**, users can select a specific week.
- In **Month View**, users can select a specific month.
- In **List View**, users can select a week to see all entries within that duration.

In **Time Approval**, the calendar defaults to the **current week** for easy review of team submissions.
### **Showing For**
In **Showing For**, users can view their own timesheet or select other members if they have permission. The option to view **All Members** is available only in **List View**.
### **Search**
Use the search bar in any view to quickly locate entries by **Task ID**, **Task Name**, or **People**. This helps users find relevant time logs without scrolling through multiple records.
### **Filter**
Apply filters to focus on specific types of time entries:

- **Status:** All, To Submit, Pending Approval, Approved, or Rejected.
- **Billable Type:** Billable or Non-Billable.

Filtering helps narrow results for better review and reporting accuracy.
### **Time Summary Metrics**
Users can instantly view important time statistics through three key metrics:

- **Total Logged:** Displays total logged hours versus total allocated capacity (for example, **5h/9h**).
- **Pending to Log:** Shows the remaining hours that are yet to be logged.
- **Utilization:** Shows the percentage of hours logged against the total allocated capacity.

These insights help users and managers evaluate productivity and ensure balanced workloads.
### **Time Approval**
If time approval is enabled, the **Time Approval** tab allows managers or authorized users to review and approve timesheets.

Key features include:
- **Members List:** Displays all members who have logged time in the selected week.
- **Calendar Widget:** Enables week selection for reviewing submissions.
- **Showing For:** View all members or filter by a single member.
- **Filter:** Filter by **Billable** or **Non-Billable** entries.
- **Search:** Quickly locate entries or members for review by searching using **Task ID**, **Task Name**, or **People**.
- **Approve / Reject:** Approve valid entries or reject those needing corrections.

This ensures time data is validated before being finalized in reports.
