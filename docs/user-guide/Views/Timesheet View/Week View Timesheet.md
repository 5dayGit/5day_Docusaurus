### **Overview**
The **Week View** allows users to see a breakdown of their time entries across a full week, making it easier to track patterns and ensure complete logging.
#### **What You Can Do in Week View**
- **View Weekly Hours**: The selected week (e.g., May 12–18) is shown with each day and corresponding logged hours clearly displayed.
- **Click and Drag to Log Time**: Users can click and drag on any day’s vertical timeline (hour slots like 01:00, 02:00, etc.) to quickly open the **Time Entry** form and log hours.
- **Change the Week**: Navigate to past or upcoming weeks using the left/right arrow buttons at the top.
- **User Switcher (Showing For)**:
  - Members will only see their own entries.
  - Admins or Project Managers (with the right permissions) can use the **“Showing For”** selector to view entries for other users.
- **Summary Section**: A summary panel is shown.
- **Search & Filter**:
  - Search: Look up time entries using task or subtask names, task or subtask IDs, or by people.
  - Filter entries by **Budget Type** (e.g., Billable / Non-Billable) to refine the view.
