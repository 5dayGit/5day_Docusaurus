## Board View: 
**Board View** in 5day.io helps you manage tasks visually in a **Kanban-style layout**, where each task appears as a card and columns represent different statuses or categories based on the **Group By** setting applied. 
### What You Can Do in Board View: 
* **View tasks as cards**   Each task appears as a card that displays key information including the **task title, assignee, due date, and task status**. 
* **Drag and drop**   Move tasks across columns to reflect changes in status or progress — based on how you’ve grouped your board. 
* **Group tasks visually**   Use **Group By** to organize your board by **status, assignee, priority, section, task type, tags, or none**. Each group shows up as a vertical column. 
* **Use filters, search, and sort**   Just like in List View, you can: 
* **Filter** tasks by assignee, priority, status, etc. 
* **Search** by Name, Task ID, Task Type, Status, Priority and Custom Field Values 
* **Sort** by attributes such as name, due date, created date, and more 
* **Customize what you see**   Use the **Customize panel** to choose which task fields to show or hide in each task card.   ✅ If **Custom Fields** are enabled in the project settings, you’ll also see an option to create new custom fields directly from here.
