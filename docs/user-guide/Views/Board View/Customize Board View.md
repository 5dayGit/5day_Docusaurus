# Customize in Board View
## Overview
The **Customize** option in Board View lets you control what information appears on each task card. You can choose which fields to display, hide the ones you don’t need, reorder fields inside the card, and even create new custom fields when enabled for the project.

Customization helps you create a clear, compact, and meaningful card layout that matches your workflow.

## How to Access It
1. Open any project in **Board View**.
1. Click the **Customize** button at the top-right corner.
1. The **Card Fields Panel** will open, showing all available standard and custom fields.

### Field Types
Within the Customize panel, you will see two types of fields:
#### 1\. Standard Fields
These are built-in task fields such as:

- Task Name
- Task ID
- Assignee
- Priority
- Status
- Section
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Progress
- Task Type
- Budget Type \*
- Tags \*
- Estimation \*
- Story Point \*
- Created By
- Created On
- Updated By
- Updated On

\* Fields marked with an asterisk appear only if the related project features are enabled.

#### 2\. Custom Fields
All supported custom fields configured for the project will also appear here.

You can:

- Toggle visibility of each custom field
- Drag and drop to reorder custom fields
- Create new custom fields (only when Custom Fields are enabled in the project)

Supported Custom Field types that can appear visually on Board View include:

- Dropdown
- Rating
- Radio Button
- Text Box
- Number
- Date
- Time
- Date & Time
- Email

#### What You Can Do
#### 1\. Toggle Visibility
Turn fields ON or OFF using the switch.\
When ON, the field appears on every task card.
#### 2\. Reorder Fields
Drag and drop fields to change the display order on the task card.
#### 3\. Pin Fields
Click the **pin icon (📌)** to pin a field at the top of every card, ensuring it remains visible regardless of card layout.
#### 4\. Create Custom Fields
Click **+ New Custom Field** at the bottom of the panel to create a new field and apply it to the project’s tasks.

(Custom Fields option only appears if the project has Custom Fields enabled.)

### Saving Your Changes
When you make any changes in the Customize panel:

- A banner appears at the top: **“This view has unsaved changes.”**
- A **Save** button and a **Cancel (❌)** icon will be shown.

Click **Save** to apply your selected field visibility and ordering for this project.

Changes will not take effect until saved.

### User-Specific Customization
Customization in Board View is **user-specific**:

- Each user can choose which fields to show or hide on their cards
- Field order is also saved per user
- Customization applies only to the **current project**

When you return to the project later, your preferred card layout remains intact.

#### Notes
- Feature-based fields (e.g., Tags, Budget Type, Estimation, Story Point) appear only if the related features are enabled in Project Settings.
- Adding a custom field makes it available to all tasks within the same project.
- Changing visibility or order does **not** affect task data—only how it is displayed on the card.
