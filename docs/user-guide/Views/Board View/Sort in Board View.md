# Sort Tasks in Board View
## Overview
The **Sort** option in Board View helps you organize how tasks appear **within each column** of the board. Sorting allows you to order task cards by fields such as Due Date, Priority, Created On, Custom Fields, and more.

This helps you view tasks in a structured order—such as earliest due date first—while keeping your Kanban-style workflow intact.

## How to Access Sort
1. Open any Project in **Board View**
1. Click the **Sort** button at the top-right of the screen
1. Select the field you want to sort by
1. Click the same field again to toggle between **ascending** and **descending**

Tasks inside each column will reorder instantly.

### Sortable Fields
#### 1\. Standard Fields
You can sort by the following built-in task fields:

- Name
- Priority
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Estimation \*
- Story Point \*
- Created On
- Updated On
- Logged Time

\*Fields marked with an asterisk appear only if their related project features are enabled.

#### 2\. Custom Fields
Sorting is supported for the following Custom Field types:

- Text Box
- Dropdown
- Rating
- Date
- Time
- Date & Time
- Email
- Radio Button

Only custom fields enabled for the project and supported by Board View will appear.

### User-Specific Sorting
Sorting in Board View is **user-specific**.\
Each user can apply their own sort order without affecting anyone else.

Sort preferences are saved **per project**, and will remain active the next time the user opens the project’s Board View.

### Saving Your Changes
When you apply or modify sorting in Board View:

- A banner appears: **“This view has unsaved changes.”**
- A **Save** button and a **Cancel (❌)** icon are shown

Click **Save** to store your sort preference for this project’s Board View.

#### Notes
- Only **one sort field** can be applied at a time (single-field sort)
- Sorting does **not** affect drag-and-drop behavior
- Sorting does **not** override Group By — grouping always determines column layout
