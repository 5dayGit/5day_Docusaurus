# Overview

In 5day.io, Discussion refers to the ability to engage in conversations, share comments, and collaborate within projects, sections, tasks, and subtasks.

Discussions enable team members to communicate effectively and share insights, updates, or feedback directly related to specific elements of the project.

By centralizing all discussions in one place, 5day.io helps keep communication transparent and organized.

## Why Discussion View Is Important

It stops the endless email threads and Slack pings. Everything lives right where the work is - inside the task or section - so no one has to hunt for “what did we decide?” 
Context stays glued to the action. You see who said what, when, and why, which cuts confusion and speeds up decisions. 
Plus, clients or new teammates can jump in and instantly catch up without a recap meeting.

## Key Features of View

-   **Threaded comments:** Reply directly to a message so the conversation stays tidy and easy to follow.
-   **@mentions:** Tag someone with @name and they get a notification - perfect for quick handoffs or approvals.
-   **File attachments:** Drop images, PDFs, or links right into the thread; no more “check your email.”
-   **Rich text:** Bold, italic, bullet lists, or code blocks - format your update so it’s clear the first time.
-   **Activity timeline:** Every comment, edit, or file shows up with a timestamp and who did it.
