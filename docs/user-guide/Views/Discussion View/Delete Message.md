# Delete Message

A **delete** option allows users to remove message they have posted at the discussion.

However, only the person who added the message can delete it. Other users, even those with access to the discussion, cannot delete message made by others.

## Delete Message

1.  Hover over the message you wish to delete.
2.  Click on the **Delete** icon (usually represented by a trash can).
3.  Confirm the deletion when prompted.

**Quick Note**
Only the **Message owner** (the person who originally added the message) can delete the message.
