# Sort Tasks in List View
## Overview
The **Sort** option in List View helps you organize how tasks are displayed by ordering them based on a specific field—such as Due Date, Priority, Estimation, or even Custom Fields.

When sections are used in a project, sorting is applied **within each section**, so tasks under each section will be ordered based on your selected sort field.

This makes it easier to view tasks in a way that fits your workflow, such as viewing all tasks by earliest due date or status.
## How to Access It
1. Open any **Project** in **List View**.
1. Click the **Sort** button located at the top-right of the screen.
1. Select the field you want to sort by.
1. Click again on the same field to toggle between **ascending** and **descending** order.
1. Tasks will automatically reorder based on the selected field and direction.
### Sortable Fields
#### 1\. Standard Fields
You can apply sort on the following built-in fields:

- Name
- Priority
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Estimation \*
- Story Point \*
- Created On
- Updated On
- Logged Time

Note: Fields marked with \* appear only if the related Project Features are enabled in Project Settings.
#### 2\. Custom Fields
Sort is supported for the following **Custom Field types**:

- Text Box
- Dropdown
- Rating
- Date
- Time
- Date & Time
- Email
- Radio Button
##### User-Specific Sorting
- Sorting is **user-specific**. Each user can apply their own sort order, and it won’t impact how others view the project.
- The sort preference is **saved per project**—so when a user returns to the project later, their sort order is preserved.
### **Saving Your Changes**
When you make any changes in the **Sort** panel:

- A banner will appear: “This view has unsaved changes.”
- You’ll see a **Save** button and a **Cancel (❌)** icon.
- Click Save to apply and store your selected sort order for this project.
#### 📝 Notes
- Sorting is applied section-wise. If your project uses sections, the tasks within each section will be sorted independently.
- You can only apply **one sort criteria** at a time (single-field sort).
