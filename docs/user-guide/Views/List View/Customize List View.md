# Customize List View
## Overview
The **Customize** option in List View lets you control exactly what fields you want to see—and in what order. You can show or hide fields, rearrange them, and even create new custom fields to fit your project needs.
## How to Access It
1. Open any project (it opens in **List View** by default).
1. Click on the **Customize** button at the top-right corner.
1. The **Column Options** panel will appear, showing all available standard and custom fields.

### Column Types
You’ll see two types of fields in the **Column Options** panel:
#### 1\. Standard Fields
These are built-in fields like:

- Due Date
- Task Type
- Task ID
- Section
- Start Date
- Progress
- Budget Type \*
- Tags \*
- Estimation \*
- Story Point \*
- Created By
- Created On
- Updated By
- Updated On
- Priority
- Assignee
- Status

Note: Fields marked with an asterisk (\*) appear only if the related Project Features are enabled.
#### 2\. Custom Fields
Any custom fields created within the project will also appear here. You can:

- Toggle visibility of custom fields
- Drag and drop to reorder them
- Create new custom fields directly from this panel
#### What You Can Do
- **Toggle Visibility**: Use the switch to turn a field on or off in the List View.
- **Reorder Fields**: Drag and drop fields to change their position.
- **Pin Fields**: Click the pin icon 📌 to lock a field’s position (it stays fixed when scrolling).
- **Create Custom Fields**: Click **+ New Custom Field** at the bottom to define a new field and apply it to tasks.
#### Saving Your Changes
When you make any changes in the **Column Options** panel:

- A message will appear: “This view has unsaved changes.”
- You’ll see a **Save** button and a cancel (❌) icon at the top.
- Click Save to apply and store your selected column option for this project.
- Changes won’t take effect until you save.
#### User-Specific Customization
- **Customize settings are user-specific.** Each user can choose which columns to show, hide, or reorder, and it will not affect how other users view the same project.
- The customization is **saved per project**—so when a user returns to the project, their preferred column layout remains intact.

#### Notes
- Some fields like **Budget Type**, **Tags**, **Estimation**, **Story Point**, and **Priority** will only appear if the corresponding features are enabled in **Project Settings**.
- Custom fields, once added, can be reused across all tasks in the same project.
