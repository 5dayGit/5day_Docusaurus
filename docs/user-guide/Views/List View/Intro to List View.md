## List View:

The **List View** helps you see all project tasks in a clean, table-like layout — ideal for teams that prefer a structured, spreadsheet-style view of their work. 
**What You Can Do in List View** 
* **View Tasks**   All tasks within a project are listed clearly for quick access and overview. 
* **Add Tasks**   Use the **Add Task** button to create new tasks directly within the view. 
* **Search Tasks**   Quickly locate tasks by name, task ID, task type, status, priority, or custom field values. 
* **Filter Tasks**   Apply filters to narrow down your view by: 
  * Assignee 
  * Status 
  * Task Type 
  * Priority 
  * Tags 
  * Section 
* **Sort Tasks**   Organize tasks by: 
  * Name 
  * Due Date 
  * Created On 
  * Start Date 
  * Last Updated 
  * Priority 
* **Group By**   View tasks grouped by: 
  * Section 
  * Status 
  * Assignee 
  * Priority 
  * Task Type 
  * Tags 
  * None (Or no grouping) 
* **Customize View**   Choose which fields you want to display. You can: 
  * Toggle on/off fields like Estimated Time, Task Type, Tags, etc. 
  * Rearrange column order (move fields up/down) 
  * If **Custom Fields** are enabled in the project, you can also **create a new custom field** from within this panel. 

### Actions in List View 
In **List View**, you can personalize how tasks appear and behave by accessing the action menu (⋮ three-dot icon) in the top right corner of the view. 
Here are the available actions: 
* #### Show Completed Tasks 
  Toggle this on to display all tasks that are marked as completed. 
* #### Show Completed Subtasks 
  Enable this to see all completed subtasks within your tasks. 
* #### Save View Changes 
  If you've customized your List View (e.g., using filters, sorting, grouping, or customize), click this to save the layout and preferences. This saved view is **user-specific** — changes are stored for your account only. 
* #### Reset to Default View 
  Restore the List View to its original, default settings — helpful if you want to discard customizations. 
* #### Set as Default View 
  Set your current List View configuration as the default view whenever you return to the project. This is also saved per user. 
* #### Show Completed Sections 
  Turn this on to display any **sections** within the project that have been marked as completed.
