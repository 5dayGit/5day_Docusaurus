# Intro to List View
## Overview
The **List View** provides a clean, table-style layout of all tasks within a project. It is ideal for teams that prefer a structured, spreadsheet-like interface for reviewing, organizing, and managing work.

With List View, you can quickly view task details, reorder fields, apply filters, and configure personalized views tailored to your workflow.
### What You Can Do in List View
#### View Tasks
All tasks (and subtasks, based on configuration) are displayed in a clear, structured list for quick access and navigation.
#### Add Tasks
Use the **Add Task** button to create tasks directly from the List View without switching screens.
#### Search Tasks
Search by task name, task ID, task type, status, priority, assignee, or supported custom field values to instantly locate the right task.
#### Filter Tasks
Narrow down your task list using filters.

You can filter by fields such as Section, Status, Assignee, Priority, Task Type, Dates, Tags, Budget Type, and supported Custom Fields.
#### Sort Tasks
Sort tasks by standard fields or custom fields to bring the most important tasks to the top of the list.
#### Group By
Organize tasks into meaningful groups — such as by Section, Assignee, Status, Priority, Task Type, Tags, or supported Custom Fields.
#### Customize View
Choose which columns to show or hide, drag and reorder fields, pin important fields, or create new custom fields — all through the **Customize** panel.
Actions in List View\
You can personalize and control the appearance and behavior of List View using the **three-dot menu (⋮)** at the top-right corner.

These view-level actions include:

- Show completed tasks
- Show completed subtasks
- Show completed sections
- Show subtask as a separate task
- Save View
- Set as Default View
- Reset to Default View

Each action helps you control visibility, structure, and default behavior of the List View in a project.

All configurations are **user-specific** and **project-specific**.

### Subscription Association
List View is **available on all subscription plans** of [5day.io](http://5day.io/).


### Roles & Permissions
The tasks you see and the actions available in List View depend on your **assigned role and permission set**.\
