# List View Features
## Overview
List View provides additional controls that help you fine-tune how tasks, subtasks, and sections are displayed. These settings allow you to show or hide completed tasks, manage how subtasks appear, and define or reset your default view for the project.

These configurations are:

- **User-specific** (every user can maintain their own preferences)
- **Project-specific** (changes apply only to the project in which they are made)

This menu ensures that each user can tailor the List View to match their working and reviewing style.
## How to Access the Additional Features
1. Navigate to any **Project → List View**.
1. At the top-right corner, click the **three-dot menu** (⋯).
1. A menu will open listing all available view-related options.

### Feature Details
Below are detailed explanations of every option available in the three-dot menu.

#### 1\. Show Completed Tasks
This option controls the visibility of tasks that are marked as **Done** (i.e., tasks whose status belongs to the "Done" stage).
##### How it works:
- **Enabled (✓)** → Completed tasks are visible.
- **Disabled** → Completed tasks are hidden from the List View.
##### Notes:
- This is a **show/hide control** only. No task data is deleted.
- Useful for decluttering the view when working with large ongoing projects.

#### 2\. Show Completed Subtasks
Functions identically to Show Completed Tasks, but specifically for **subtasks**.
##### Behavior:
- **Enabled (✓)** → Completed subtasks appear under their parent tasks (or separately, if “Show subtask as a separate task” is active).
- **Disabled** → All subtasks with status in Done stage are hidden.

#### 3\. Show Completed Sections
Sections also have statuses (New, In Progress, Done).
##### Behavior:
- If this option is **disabled**, all sections marked **Done** will be hidden from the List View.
- If **enabled (✓)**, completed sections are shown normally.

#### 4\. Save View
Use **Save View** to save all the visual configurations currently applied, such as:

- Filters
- Sort selections
- Group By configuration
- Column customizations (Customize → visibility/reorder)
#### 5\. Set as Default View
This option allows the user to set the current List View state as their **default view** for the project.
##### Behavior:
- Once set, every time the user opens this project, the chosen view will be automatically loaded.
- The default view may include:
  - Selected columns
  - Group By field
  - Sort field
  - Filters
  - Any other view-level configurations applied by the user (e.g., Show completed tasks, Show subtasks as separate tasks, etc.)
#### 6\. Reset to Default View
This option restores the **system’s original List View** configuration.
##### What it resets:
- All filters
- Sort order
- Group By selection
- Any other view-level configurations applied by the user (e.g., Show completed tasks, Show subtasks as separate tasks, etc.)
#### 7\. Show Subtask as a Separate Task
This option determines **how subtasks appear** in the List View.
##### Behavior:
- **Enabled (✓)**:
  - Subtasks appear directly inside their corresponding sections (if the subtask’s section is different from the parent task).
  - The user can treat them like standalone tasks in the list.
- **Disabled**:
  - Subtasks appear only inside their parent task, visible when expanding the parent row.
##### Notes:
- This is especially helpful for teams using multiple sections or workflows where subtasks move independently.
