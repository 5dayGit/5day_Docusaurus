## Timeline View Date Range:
Timeline View supports multiple date-based views that help you understand tasks across different date ranges.

You can switch between Week and Month views depending on how much detail you want to see, and use the **Today** option to instantly return to the current date.

Each view adjusts the layout of tasks and subtasks on the timeline to give you a clear picture of scheduled work and upcoming deadlines.
#### Week View
- Shows **7 days** at a time.
- Each column is one calendar day.
- Multi-day tasks appear as continuous bars across multiple columns.
- Best suited for weekly planning and short-term execution.
#### Month View
- Shows the **full month** (depending on calendar).
- The view is more compact, and tasks appear as bars or chips at their respective dates.
- Best suited for long-term planning, milestones, and quarterly overviews.
#### Today
- Centers the timeline on **today’s date** and highlights it with a vertical line.
- Useful when you have navigated far into the past or future dates.
