## Timeline View Zoom In-Zoom Out
Timeline View Zoom levels control how much of the timeline you can see at once.

Using the **+** and **–** icons, you can zoom in to focus on a smaller date range or zoom out to see a broader period such as a full month or quarter.

Zooming changes:

- The **number of days or months** visible on screen
- The **width of each date column**
- The **density** of task bars on the timeline

This helps you switch easily between detailed scheduling and high-level planning.

For example, zooming in is useful when adjusting specific task dates, while zooming out helps understand overall project timelines and milestones.
### Zoom Levels
Use the **+ –** icons in the bottom-right corner to adjust zoom.

Zoom changes how much date is visible and the width of each date column:

- **Level 1** – Highest zoom-in, approx. **1 week** visible.
- **Level 2 (Default)** – About **3 weeks** visible.
- **Level 3** – **1 month** visible.
- **Level 4** – **1 quarter (3 months)** visible.
- **Level 5** – **2 quarters (6 months)** visible (for example, Q3 and Q4).
