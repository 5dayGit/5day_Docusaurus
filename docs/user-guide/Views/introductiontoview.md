### **Overview**
Views in 5day.io help you organize and visualize your project tasks in the way that works best for you and your team.

Whether you're reviewing a long list of tasks or managing work through visual stages, 5day.io supports multiple powerful ways to interact with your project:

- **List View** – See all tasks in a structured list format.
- **Board View** – View tasks as cards and drag them across stages (like “New,” “In Progress,” and “Done”).
- **Timesheet View** – Track time entries across days, weeks, or months.
- **Dashboard** – Analyze work through prebuilt reports and widgets.
- **Files View** – Store, upload, and manage project files.
- **Discussion View** – Start and reply to conversations around the project.
- **Activity Stream** – View a real-time feed of all project changes.

These views are **project-specific** and tightly integrated with your workflows. Users with project settings access can customize views to suit their needs.
