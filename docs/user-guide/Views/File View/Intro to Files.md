# Overview
In 5day.io, **Files** refer to any digital documents, images, spreadsheets, PDFs, or other project-related assets that are uploaded and associated with projects, sections, tasks, or subtasks.

These files can be accessed, shared, and managed by team members based on their permissions, helping to centralize project documentation and collaboration.

The Files section is designed to store and organize these resources for easy retrieval, sharing, and management within your workspace.

## Why File View Is Important 

No more “where’s that file?” or “did you send the latest version?” 

Everything lives right with the work - attached to the task or section it belongs to. You cut the clutter of shared drives and email attachments. 

Team members grab what they need in one click, clients see only what you want them to, and everyone works off the same up-to-date file. 

It keeps projects moving without the back-and-forth.

## Key Features of File View

-   **Attach anywhere** – Drop files directly into projects, sections, tasks, subtasks or even a message.
-   **Preview without download** – Click images, or PDFs, to see them right in the browser.
-   **Permission controls** – Set who can view, edit, or download -team, client, or read-only.
-   **Search & filter** – Find any file by name, type, or uploader in seconds.
-   **Direct links** – Share a secure link to a file without giving full project access.
