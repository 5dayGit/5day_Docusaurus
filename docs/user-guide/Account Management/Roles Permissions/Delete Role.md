## How to Delete a Role
In 5day.io, you can delete any **default or custom role**, except for the **Account Owner** role.\
Note: The Account Owner role is mandatory and always assigned to at least one user, so it cannot be deleted.
### **Steps to Delete a Role:**
1. Go to **Account Settings**.
1. Click on **Security & Permissions** from the sidebar.
1. Under the **Roles & Permissions** section, you will see the list of all roles (both default and custom).
1. Find the role you want to delete.
1. Click on the **three-dot menu** (⋮) next to that role.
1. Select **Delete**.
1. A confirmation box will appear — click **Confirm** to proceed.

✅ Once confirmed, the role will be permanently deleted from your system.
### **Important Notes:**
- You can delete both **default** and **custom roles**, except for the **Account Owner** role.
- You cannot delete a role if it is currently **assigned to active users** — reassign users to a different role before deletion.
- Deleting a role is **permanent** and cannot be undone.
