# Guest Role — Permissions
## **Overview**
The **Guest** role in 5day.io is designed for **external users**, such as clients or consultants, who need limited access to specific projects or tasks they’ve been invited to.\
Guests typically have **view-only access** and cannot create or edit work. They are ideal for stakeholders who only need to monitor progress.
