# Account Admin Role — Permissions
## **Overview**
In 5day.io, the **Account Admin** is a key role responsible for managing users, workspace configuration, project operations, and platform-wide settings.\
Unlike the Account Owner, Account Admins **do not have full access to subscription and billing**.

The Account Admin has full rights assigned by default across:

- **Global Permissions** (with limited access to Subscription & Billing)
- **Feature Permissions** (identical to Account Owner with minor display difference for Discussions and Files)

## **About Global and Feature Permission Options**
- **Manage (Global Permissions):**\
  "Manage" allows the user to fully **view, configure, update, and control** the corresponding account setting area.
- **All (Feature Permissions):**\
  "All" means the user can **view, add, edit, and delete** **any** work item across the workspace,\
  not just the ones assigned to or created by them.

🔵 Note:\
In the **Account Admin** role, the **Subscription and Billing** permission is **limited to View** access.

Note: In Discussions and Files, Edit and Delete access are automatically included when Add permission is enabled.
