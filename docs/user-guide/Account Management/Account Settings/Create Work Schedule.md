# **Create a Work Schedule**
In 5day.io, you can create custom work schedules to define working hours, hybrid work models, and holidays for your team. You can either **create a new schedule from scratch** or **duplicate an existing one** to save time.
### **1. Create a New Work Schedule**
1. **Go to Work Schedule:**
   Navigate to **Account Settings → General → Work Schedule**.
1. **Click on Add:**
   Inside the Work Schedule section, click the **Add** button next to the list of existing work schedules to start creating a new one.
1. **Enter Work Schedule Name:**
   Give your new work schedule a meaningful name (e.g., *"Regular Working Hours"* or *"US Hybrid Team"*).

1. **Define Work Days and Settings:**
   1. **Start of Calendar Week:** Choose between Monday or Sunday.
   1. **Enable Hybrid Work:**
      1. Assign work location (Home or Office) per day.
      1. Optionally allow members to update their hybrid working status manually.

      Select the days that are active (e.g., Monday–Friday).

      Define working hours for each active day.

### **2. Duplicate an Existing Work Schedule**
If you already have a work schedule similar to the one you need, you can simply duplicate it and make changes instead of creating a new one from scratch.

Here’s how:

1. **Go to Work Schedule:**
   Navigate to **Account Settings → General → Work Schedule**.
1. **Find the Schedule to Duplicate:**
   Locate the existing work schedule you want to copy.
1. **Click the Three-Dot Menu (⋮):**
   Next to the schedule name, click on the three dots.
1. **Select Duplicate:**\
   Click on the **Duplicate** option from the menu.
1. **Edit the Duplicated Work Schedule:**
   1. The duplicated schedule will appear immediately.
   1. You can modify the work days, hours, hybrid settings, and holidays as needed.
   1. Update the **Work Schedule Name** to reflect the new schedule.
