# List of Workflow
**List of Workflows** shows every automation rule you’ve created inside the your project - all in one clean screen so you can see what’s running, pause anything, or jump straight to edits.

## Permission Set
You need **Edit Project** permission to view and manage the full list.

## List of Workflows 

Project → three dots → **Project Settings** → **Workflows**

**What you’ll see for each workflow**

-   **Name of Workflow** The exact name you gave it. Click the name to open full details.
-   **Color and Icon** The visual badge you picked - makes it dead easy to spot the right one at a glance.
-   **Active / Inactive toggle** 
	- Green = Active Workflow
	- Grey = paused/ Inactive Workflow
	- Note: Flip the switch anytime - no editing needed
-   **Created By** Who built it first.
-   **Updated By** Who last touched it (plus timestamp) - perfect for “wait, who changed this?” moments.
-   **Actions** (three dots menu)
    -   **Edit** → jump straight into changing trigger/conditions/actions.
    -   **Delete** → removes it forever (you’ll get a warning before delete)

That’s your control center: everything in one place, zero hunting around. Turn rules on/off in a click, keep the good ones, ditch the old ones - your project stays perfectly automated without any clutter.
