# Intro to Automation

Automation in 5day.io is your team's silent superhero that handles repetitive work automatically. You set up simple rules once, and every time something happens in a project, the system does the rest—no manual clicks, no forgotten steps.

## **Why is Automation Important**

-   Stops tasks from falling through the cracks.
-   Saves hours every week on boring updates.
-   Keeps everyone in sync without endless “hey, did you…?” messages.
-   Makes sure nothing gets missed when people are busy or on leave.

## **Key Features of Automation**

-   Works only inside the project where you create it.
-   Triggers instantly when something changes (status update, new comment, due date passed, etc.).
-   Can check extra conditions before running (“only if priority is High”).
-   Does useful actions: change status, assign people, add tags, send notifications, move tasks.
-   Shows exactly what it did and when in the Activity Stream.

Think of it as giving your project a brain that never sleeps. You teach it your rules once, then go focus on real work while 5day.io keeps everything moving perfectly.
