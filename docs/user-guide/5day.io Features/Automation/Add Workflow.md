## Add Workflow

Follow these steps to create your workflow:

1.  Go to your project -> click the three dots -> **Project Settings** -> **Workflows**
2.  Click **+ Add Workflow**
3.  Fill in the details:

| Field | Description  |
|--|--|
| Name | Give it a clear name like “Auto-close completed tasks” or “Alert on overdue”. |
| Icon and Color| Pick an icon and color so it’s easy to spot in the list. |
| Description | Add a short note about what this workflow does – helps teammates understand later. |

### Define a Rule
This is the brain of your workflow – the exact “if this, then that” logic.

-   **Trigger** (mandatory): The event that starts the workflow. 
- Certain examples are like:
	- Task status changed 
	- Due date passed 
	- New comment added 
	- Subtask completed.
-   **Conditions** (optional): Extra checks before running. 
- Certain examples are like: 
	- Only if Priority = High 
	- Only if Assignee = Marketing Team 
	- Only if Tags contain “urgent”.
-   **Action** (mandatory): What actually happens. 
- Certain examples are like:
	- Change status to Done 
	- Assign to Manager 
	- Add tag “review-needed” 
	- Send notification 
	- Move to section “Section 5”.

4. Save your workflow.

Your new workflow instantly appears in the **List of Workflows** and starts working immediately (toggle it off anytime if you want to pause it).

That’s it - one workflow, hundreds of clicks saved every week!
