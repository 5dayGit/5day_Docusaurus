# Intro to Workflow

A **Workflow** in 5day.io is the smart rule that powers your Automation. It’s the “if this, then that” recipe you create once and let run forever inside a project.

## **Why Workflow is Important**

-   Ends the daily grind of moving tasks, updating statuses, or chasing people.
-   Makes your team 10x faster without extra effort.
-   Keeps every project consistent - even when different people work on it.
-   Turns chaos into clockwork, every single time.

## **Key Features of Workflow**

-   Lives inside one project (keeps things clean and safe).
-   Super-simple setup: pick a Trigger → add Conditions (optional) → choose Actions.
-   Runs instantly and silently in the background.
-   Logs every single move in the Activity Stream so you always know what happened.
-   You can turn it on/off or edit it any time.

In short: one Workflow = hundreds of manual clicks saved. Build a few good ones and watch your project basically run itself.
