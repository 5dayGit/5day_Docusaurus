# Workflow Actions

**Actions** are the “do this” part - the magic that happens automatically once your trigger + conditions say GO. One click = hundreds of manual steps saved forever.

## How Actions work
After trigger fires -> conditions pass -> 5day.io instantly runs every action in your list (top to bottom). You can stack as many actions as you want.

Actions comes with two categories:

 1. Field-update Actions
 2. Email Actions

### Field-update Actions (set any field automatically)
You can set every single field that exists on tasks/subtasks
| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| Status | Set a specific Status |
| Priority | Set a specific priority |
| Budget Type | Set a budget type - Billable/Non-billable |
| Progress | Set a progress |
| Estimation | Set an Estimation - Support all 5 formats |
| Tags | Add/Remove a tag |
| Section | Move to a section |
| Assignee | Add/Remove assignee |
| Start Date | Set a dynamic/custom start date |
| Due Date | Set a dynamic/custom due date |

### Email & Notification Actions
Select Email -> Send Email to create a full email that flies out.
| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| To | Add single/multiple email addresses to which the email needs to be sent. |
| Cc | Add people in Cc. |
| Subject | Set a subject for an email |
