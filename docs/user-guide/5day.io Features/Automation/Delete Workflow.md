# Delete Workflow

**Delete Workflow** permanently removes an automation rule from your project. Use it when a rule is outdated, duplicated, or no longer needed - keeps your list clean and tidy.

## **Permission Set** 
You must have **Edit Project** permission to delete workflows.

## Delete Workflow

1.  Open your project -> three dots -> **Project Settings** → **Workflows**
2.  Find the workflow → click the three dots (⋮) next to it
3.  Choose **Delete**
4.  Upon the confirmation, workflow will be deleted from project.

### **What happens next**

-   The workflow stops instantly - no more triggers or actions.
-   It disappears from the List of Workflows forever.
-   Every past run stays visible in the Activity Stream (so you still have the history).
-   No way to recover it - deletion is permanent.

**Quick Note**
Not sure? Just toggle it to **Inactive** first. You can always turn it back on later. Delete only when you’re 100% sure it’s gone for good.

That’s it — one click, zero clutter, happier project!
