# Edit Workflow

In 5day.io, **Edit Workflow** lets you update any existing automation rule to keep it perfectly in sync with your team’s changing process. Tweak the name, logic, or actions in seconds—changes apply instantly across the project.

## Permission Set
You should have **Edit Project** permission to modify workflows in the project.

## Edit Workflow

1.  Open your project -> three dots -> **Project Settings** -> **Workflows**
    
2.  Find the workflow you want to change → click on Three dots -> click on **Edit** (pencil icon).
    
3.  Update whatever you need:
    
	   **Mark as Active/Inactive** Click on Toggle button to make your workflow active/inactive.
   
	  **Name of Workflow** Make it clearer or rename it completely.
    
	  **Icon and Color** Change the look so it stands out better in the list.
    
	  **Description** Add or update notes for your teammates.
    
	  **Define a Rule** Fine-tune the logic exactly like when you created it:
    
	   -   **Trigger** – change or keep what starts the workflow
    -   **Conditions** – add, remove, or adjust the “only if” checks
    -   **Action** – swap, add, or remove what happens automatically
4.  Click **Save Workflow**
    
Your updated workflow takes effect immediately - no restart needed. All future triggers will follow the new rules, and every change is logged in the Activity Stream.

That’s it - one quick edit keeps your project running like clockwork!
