# **Profile in My Settings**
## **Overview**
The **Profile** section inside My Settings in 5day.io lets users manage their personal information and tailor how the application looks and behaves — all in one place.\
It’s designed to give every user full control over their **identity settings** and **display preferences**.

The Profile settings are organized into two parts:

### **1. Profile**
In this section, users can update their personal details, including:

- **First Name** and **Last Name**
- **Phone Number**
- **Email Address**
- **Date of Birth**
- **Profile Picture** (upload or change)

This helps keep your identity accurate across all your 5day.io workspaces and collaborations.

### **2. Display**
The Display tab allows users to customize how 5day.io appears and functions for them, including:

- **Time Zone**: Set your local working time zone
- **Time Format**: Choose between 12-hour or 24-hour formats
- **Language**: Default is English (currently fixed)
- **Date Format**: Choose how dates are displayed (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Duration Format**: Define how durations (like work hours) are displayed
- **Theme**: Choose a light or dark mode to personalize your experience
- **Layout**: Decide where the navigation menu should appear — **Left Navigation** or **Top Navigation**

✅ Everything you configure here applies only to your personal account experience and is visible only to you.
