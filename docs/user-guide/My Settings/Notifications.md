# Notifications – Overview
Notifications in 5day.io let you stay in control of how and when you receive updates about your work. Whether it's task assignments, project activity, comments, or reminders — you can customize what alerts you get and where they appear (Web, Mobile, or Email).

In 5day.io, notifications help you stay updated on key actions like task assignments, project updates, comments, reminders, and more. You have full control over which notifications you receive — and where you receive them (email, web, or mobile).

You can also customize your experience further with:

- **Do Not Disturb Mode** – Temporarily silence notifications during specific hours or days.
- **Pause Notifications** – Disable all notifications until you choose to turn them back on.

With these settings, 5day.io ensures that you're always informed — but never overwhelmed.

### **How to Access Notifications**
To manage your notifications in 5day.io:

1. Click on your **profile icon** in the top or bottom navigation bar (based on your layout).
1. From the dropdown, select **My Settings**.
1. Inside **My Settings**, click on the **Notifications** tab.

From here, you’ll be able to:

- Enable or disable notifications for tasks, projects, comments, reminders, and timesheets.
- Choose where you want to receive updates — **Web**, **Email**, or **Mobile**.
- Configure **Do Not Disturb** or **Pause Notifications** to control when and how you get notified.

This gives you full control over your notification preferences.
