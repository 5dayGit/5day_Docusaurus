# **Work Schedule in My Settings**
## **Overview**
The **Work Schedule** section in 5day.io allows users to view the working hours and holiday calendar assigned to them by their organization.\
By default, each user is assigned an organization-defined work schedule, which outlines their working days, daily start and end times. It also displays the **start of the calendar week**, the **total daily working duration**, and the **holiday list** for the current year.

If this assigned schedule doesn’t reflect a user's actual working pattern, they can easily **switch to another work schedule** from a list of options configured by their organization.
## **How to Change Your Work Schedule**
In 5day.io, your organization assigns a default work schedule, but if it doesn’t align with your actual working hours, you have the flexibility to change it.
### **Steps to Change Your Work Schedule:**
1. Go to **My Settings** by clicking your profile icon in the navigation bar.
1. From the menu, select **Work Schedule**.
1. On the Work Schedule page, click the **Change** button.
1. A list of all available work schedules set by your organization will appear.
1. Select the schedule that matches your working pattern.

✅ Once selected, the new work schedule will be automatically applied to your profile.
