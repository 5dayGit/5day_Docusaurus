## App Performance

### Loading Speed

#### Initial Load Time
```
Target: &lt; 3 seconds
Actual: ~2.1 seconds (global average)

Factors:
  - Internet speed
  - Geographic location
  - Server load
  - Cache status
```

#### Page Navigation
```
Target: &lt; 500ms
Actual: ~250ms average

Optimization:
  ✓ Prefetching

```

### Reducing Load Times

**Use the Desktop App**
```
Benefits:
  ✓ Faster startup
  ✓ Better caching
  ✓ Offline support
  ✓ Native performance
  
Download: example.com/download
```

**Enable Hardware Acceleration**
```
Chrome:
  Settings → System → Use hardware acceleration

Firefox:
  Settings → Performance → Use recommended settings

This uses your GPU for better performance
```

## Data Management

### Large Projects

#### Project Size Limits
```
Free Plan:
  Tasks: 1,000 per project
  Files: 10 GB total
  Members: 10

Pro Plan:
  Tasks: 10,000 per project
  Files: 100 GB total
  Members: 100

Enterprise:

```

#### Archiving Old Data
```
When to Archive:
  - Completed projects
  - Tasks older than 6 months
  - Inactive projects
  
Benefits:
  ✓ Faster loading
  ✓ Cleaner interface
  ✓ Better search results
  ✓ Data still accessible
```

### File Management

Total Storage:
  Free: 2 GB
  Pro: 100 GB
  Enterprise: Custom
```

#### Optimizing Files
```
Images:
  - Compress before upload
  - Use JPEG for photos
  - Use PNG for graphics
  - Recommended: &lt; 5 MB
  
Videos:
  - Compress or use external hosting
  - Recommended: &lt; 50 MB
  - Consider YouTube/Vimeo links
  
Documents:
  - PDFs: Optimize/compress
  - Remove embedded fonts
  - Recommended: &lt; 10 MB
```

## Search Performance

### Search Optimization

**Use Specific Terms**
```
❌ Slow: "task"
✅ Fast: "homepage design task"

❌ Slow: "file"
✅ Fast: "Q4 budget spreadsheet"
```

**Use Filters**
```
Instead of searching everything:
  ✓ Filter by project
  ✓ Filter by date range
  ✓ Filter by assignee
  ✓ Filter by status

This dramatically improves search speed
```

### Search Index
```
Updates: Real-time
Full reindex: Nightly
Searchable content:
  ✓ Task names and descriptions
  ✓ Comments
  ✓ File names
  ✓ Project names
  ✗ File contents (coming soon)
```

## Network Optimization

### Bandwidth Usage

```
Typical Usage:
  Light use: ~10 MB/hour
  Normal use: ~50 MB/hour
  Heavy use: ~200 MB/hour
  
File uploads/downloads: Variable
```

### Offline Mode

**Desktop & Mobile Apps**
```
Automatic caching:
  ✓ Recent tasks
  ✓ Active projects
  ✓ Your assignments
  
Offline capabilities:
  ✓ View cached content
  ✓ Create/edit tasks
  ✓ Add comments
  ✓ Auto-sync when online
```

### Connection Issues

```
Handling Poor Connectivity:
  1. Automatic retry on failures
  2. Queue actions for later sync
  3. Show offline indicator
  4. Warn before data loss
  
Minimum required: 1 Mbps
Recommended: 10 Mbps or higher
```

## Database Performance

### Query Optimization

**Smart Loading**
```
We automatically:
  ✓ Load visible content first
  ✓ Lazy load below-fold content
  ✓ Paginate large lists
  ✓ Cache frequently accessed data
```

**Pagination**
```
Default: 50 items per page
Configurable: 25, 50, 100, 200

Larger pages = more data = slower load
Recommendation: Keep at 50 for best balance
```

### Indexing

```
Optimized Queries:
  ✓ Status changes
  ✓ Assignment lookups
  ✓ Due date searches
  ✓ Project filtering
  ✓ Text search
  
Automatic optimization:
  ✓ Query caching
  ✓ Smart indexing
  ✓ Load balancing
```

## API Performance

### Rate Limiting
```
Limits per API key:
  Free: 1,000 requests/hour
  Pro: 10,000 requests/hour
  Enterprise: Custom
  
Best practices:
  ✓ Cache responses locally
  ✓ Use webhooks instead of polling
  ✓ Batch requests when possible
  ✓ Respect rate limit headers
```

### API Optimization

**Batch Requests**
```javascript
// ❌ Slow: Multiple requests
const tasks = await Promise.all([
  fetch('/api/tasks/1'),
  fetch('/api/tasks/2'),
  fetch('/api/tasks/3')
]);

// ✅ Fast: Single batch request
const tasks = await fetch('/api/tasks?ids=1,2,3');
```

**Field Selection**
```javascript
// ❌ Slow: Fetch everything
fetch('/api/tasks')

// ✅ Fast: Only what you need
fetch('/api/tasks?fields=id,name,status')
```

**Pagination**
```javascript
// ✅ Use cursor-based pagination
fetch('/api/tasks?limit=50&cursor=abc123')
```

### Webhooks vs Polling

```
Polling (Inefficient):
  ❌ Wastes bandwidth
  ❌ Increases latency
  ❌ Hits rate limits

Webhooks (Recommended):
  ✅ Real-time updates
  ✅ No wasted requests
  ✅ Better performance
  ✅ Lower costs
```

## Monitoring Performance

### Performance Metrics

```

  Page load: &lt; 3s (target: 2s)
  API calls: &lt; 500ms (target: 200ms)
  Search: &lt; 1s (target: 500ms)
  File upload: Depends on size/speed
```

### System Status
